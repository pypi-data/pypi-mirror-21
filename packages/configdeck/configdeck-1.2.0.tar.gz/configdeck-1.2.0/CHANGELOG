Version 1.2.0
=============

:Released: 2017-04-22
:Maintainer: Ben Finney <ben+python@benfinney.id.au>

Known issues
------------

* Python 3.4 and later have changed the behaviour of `configparser` in
  a way that breaks `SchemaConfigParser`. This code base currently
  does not support Python 3.4 and later.

  Pagure: https://pagure.io/python-configdeck/issue/1

Bug fixes
---------

* The `ini2schema` function did not obey the `Option.short_name`
  attribute for command-line options.

* Interpolation of values was incorrectly parsing items for list and
  dict option types.

  Pagure: https://pagure.io/python-configdeck/issue/3

* The interpolation of values was incorrectly ignoring errors when
  parsing a value.

  Pagure: https://pagure.io/python-configdeck/issue/2

Changes
-------

* The project is now named Configdeck.

* The top-level Python package that was named `configglue` is now
  named `configdeck`.

* The `configglue.glue` module is now named `configdeck.deck`.


Version 1.1.3
=============

:Released: 2015-10-10
:Maintainer: Ricardo Kirkner <ricardo.kirkner@canonical.com>

Bug fixes
---------

* Multiple included configuration files are now parsed once each, and
  in the order they are specified.

* The same section defined in multiple files were incorrectly
  overriding a previously-parsed section with the same name from
  another file.

Additions
---------

* Configglue now supports Python 2 versions 2.6, 2.7, and Python 3
  versions 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5.

* Value interpolation in a configuration file can now access values
  defined in a different configuration file.


Version 1.1.2
=============

:Released: 2013-07-11
:Maintainer: Ricardo Kirkner <ricardo.kirkner@canonical.com>

Bug fixes
---------

* The differences between Python 2 and Python 3 implementations of
  `ConfigParser` are now abstracted using code from Python's standard
  library.


Version 1.1.1
=============

:Released: 2013-07-08
:Maintainer: Ricardo Kirkner <ricardo.kirkner@canonical.com>

Bug fixes
---------

* The configuration file is now opened using an explicit text
  encoding, to avoid unwanted differences between locales.


Version 1.1.0
=============

:Released: 2013-05-27
:Maintainer: Ricardo Kirkner <ricardo.kirkner@canonical.com>

Additions
---------

* Configglue now supports Python 2 versions 2.6, 2.7, and Python 3
  versions 3.2, 3.3.

* Environment variables may now also be interpolated in values using
  shell-style ``${FOO}`` syntax.

Changes
-------

* Configglue now uses its own named loggers, via Python's `logging`
  framework, to emit log messages.


Version 1.0.3
=============

:Released: 2012-05-05
:Maintainer: Ricardo Kirkner <ricardo.kirkner@canonical.com>

Changes
-------

* The plug-in schema that was named `OpenIdSchema` is now named
  `DjangoOpenIdAuthSchema`.

* The plug-in schema that was named `StatsdSchema` is now named
  `PyStatsdSchema`.


Version 1.0.2
=============

:Released: 2012-04-25
:Maintainer: Ricardo Kirkner <ricardo.kirkner@canonical.com>

Additions
---------

* The following plug-in schemas are now installed:

  * `DevServerSchema`
  * `DjangoJenkinsSchema`
  * `NexusSchema`
  * `OpenIdSchema`
  * `PreflightSchema`
  * `RavenSchema`
  * `Saml2IdpSchema`
  * `StatsdSchema`


Version 1.0.1
=============

:Released: 2012-01-04
:Maintainer: Ricardo Kirkner <ricardo.kirkner@canonical.com>

Bug fixes
---------

* Option values that specified value interpolation were sometimes not
  parsed correctly.


Version 1.0
===========

:Release: 2011-08-05
:Maintainer: Ricardo Kirkner <ricardo.kirkner@canonical.com>

Additions
---------

* The `App` class constructor now accepts a parameter for the
  command-line option parser – an `optparse.OptionParser` instance –
  to use.

* Complex option types – e.g. `ListOption`, `DictOption` – can now
  accept a value from the command-line options. The value is parsed as
  JSON and deserialised to the option value.

* The command-line parser option 'validate' now instructs the program
  to validate its configuration, and exit with an error if the
  validation fails.

* The configuration file parser now emits a warning-level log message
  if the configuration file cannot be read.

Changes
-------

* All the modules from the `configglue.pyschema` package are now
  located in the `configglue` package.

* All the option classes that were named `…ConfigOption` are now named
  `…Option`. For example, `IntConfigOption` is now named `IntOption`.

* The classes that were named `ConfigOption` and `ConfigSection` are
  now named `Option` and `Section`, respectively.

Removals
--------

* The `configglue.pyschema` package is removed.


Version 0.11.1
==============

:Released: 2011-07-09
:Maintainer: Ricardo Kirkner <ricardo.kirkner@canonical.com>

Bug fixes
---------

* Extra sections in `DictOption` and `ListOption` were sometimes
  failing to parse extra sections.

Additions
---------

* The command-line option name can now be set explicitly on an option
  definition.

  Closes: LP#733977.

* The documentation now describes many changes in past versions.


Version 0.11
============

:Released: 2011-06-24
:Maintainer: Ricardo Kirkner <ricardo.kirkner@canonical.com>

Bug fixes
---------

* The `fatal` attribute of an option now does not prevent the `--help`
  option from working.

  Closes: LP#757955.

* Option values are now represented as Python objects of the
  appropriate type, and converted to and from text strings only when
  needed.

  Closes: LP#793060.

Additions
---------

* All the option classes named `…ConfigOption` now have aliases named
  `…Option`. For example, `IntConfigOption` has an alias named
  `IntOption`. These aliases are now the recommended names.

* The classes named `ConfigOption` and `ConfigSection` now have
  aliases named `Option` and `Section`, respectively. These aliases
  are now the recommended names.

* The classes `configglue.app.App` and `configglue.app.Config` allows
  defining an application and its configuration.

* Configuration options are now also parsed from corresponding
  environment variables, if set.

* A configuration file can specify a value interpolated with an
  environment variable's value.

Changes
-------

* A section must now be defined as a class within the schema class
  definition.

  Closes: LP#753395.

============

:Released: 2011-05-02

-------

* The configuration file parser now inherits from the recommended
  `ConfigParser.SafeConfigParser`.
