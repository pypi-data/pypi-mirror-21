We use `Pagure issues`_ to track feature requests. If you see
something that you’d like, add a “thumbs up” reaction to the issue to
show your support. Please do a quick search to see whether the issue
has already been reported.

The `roadmap/current label`_ on issues provides a list of larger
projects that we are currently working on.

The `roadmap/upcoming label`_ on issues provides a list of larger
projects that we expect to work on next.

If you’d like to contribute to this work, take a look at our
documentation on :doc:`contributing and development <index>`.
