Configglue
##########

HOWTO do a release:

* edit setup.py and set the correct version number
* verify that setup.py sdist generates a tarball and you are completely confident
  that all the contents of the tarball are correct (any new files are there, etc.)
* run python setup.py sdist register upload, you will be prompted to login to pypi
  and the new release is registered and uploaded.
* To also upload to launchpad:
  - manage-credentials create -c ubuntu-dev-tools -l 2 (only if you don't have this already)
  - lp-project-upload configglue 0.9pre1 configglue-0.9pre1.tar.gz (substituting correct versions)
* Prepare a new ubuntu package from the tarball.
