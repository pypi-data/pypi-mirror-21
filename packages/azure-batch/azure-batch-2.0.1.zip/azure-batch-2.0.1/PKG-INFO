        Release History
        ===============
        
        2.0.1 (2017-04-19)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        This wheel package is now built with the azure wheel extension
        
        2.0.0 (2017-02-23)
        ++++++++++++++++++
        
        - AAD token authentication now supported.
        - Some operation names have changed (along with their associated parameter model classes):
          * pool.list_pool_usage_metrics -> pool.list_usage_metrics
          * pool.get_all_pools_lifetime_statistics -> pool.get_all_lifetime_statistics
          * job.get_all_jobs_lifetime_statistics -> job.get_all_lifetime_statistics
          * file.get_node_file_properties_from_task -> file.get_properties_from_task
          * file.get_node_file_properties_from_compute_node -> file.get_properties_from_compute_node
        - The attribute 'file_name' in relation to file operations has been renamed to 'file_path'.
        - Change in naming convention for enum values to use underscores: e.g. StartTaskState.waitingforstarttask -> StartTaskState.waiting_for_start_task.
        - Support for running tasks under a predefined or automatic user account. This includes tasks, job manager tasks, job preparation and release tasks and pool start tasks. This feature replaces the previous 'run_elevated' option on a task.
        - Tasks now have an optional scoped authentication token (only applies to tasks and job manager tasks).
        - Support for creating pools with a list of user accounts.
        - Support for creating pools using a custom VM image (only supported on accounts created with a "User Subscription" pool allocation mode).
