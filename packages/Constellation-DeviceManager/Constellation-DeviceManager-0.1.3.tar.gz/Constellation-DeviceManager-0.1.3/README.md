Constellation Device Manager
============================

This module implements a device registration system for managing MAC addresses within an organization.  Presently it implements a flat structure for storing MAC addresses but groups are planned for the future.  Like other Constallation Apps, this requires the availability of the Constellation Base module in your Django installation.
