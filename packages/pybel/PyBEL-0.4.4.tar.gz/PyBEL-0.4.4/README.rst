PyBEL
=====

:code:`pybel` is a Python software package that parses BEL scripts, validates their semantics, and facilitates data
interchange between common formats and database systems like JSON, CSV, Excel, SQL, CX, and Neo4J. Its companion
package, `PyBEL Tools <http://pybel-tools.readthedocs.io/>`_, contains a library of functions for analysis of
biological networks.

Biological Expression Language (BEL) is a domain-specific language that enables the expression of complex molecular
relationships and their context in a machine-readable form. Its simple grammar and expressive power have led to its
successful use in the `IMI <https://www.imi.europa.eu/>`_ project, `AETIONOMY <http://www.aetionomy.eu/>`_, to describe
complex disease networks with several thousands of relationships.

:code:`pybel` provides a simple API so bioinformaticians and scientists with limited programming knowledge can easily
use it to interface with BEL graphs, but is built on a rich framework that can be extended to develop new algorithms.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import pybel, networkx
   >>> g = pybel.from_url('http://resource.belframework.org/belframework/1.0/knowledge/small_corpus.bel')
   >>> networkx.draw(g)  # NOTE: requires matplotlib as a dependency, which isn't automatically installed

PyBEL also installs a command line interface with the command :code:`pybel` for simple utilities such as data
conversion. Need help? All logs go to :code:`~/.pybel` or add :code:`-v` for verbose output to the standard error
stream. In this example, a BEL file is exported to GraphML for viewing in Cytoscape.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pybel convert --path ~/Desktop/example.bel --graphml ~/Desktop/example.graphml
   
In Cytoscape, open with :code:`Import > Network > From File`.

More examples can be found in the `PyBEL Notebooks <https://github.com/pybel/pybel-notebooks>`_ repository.
