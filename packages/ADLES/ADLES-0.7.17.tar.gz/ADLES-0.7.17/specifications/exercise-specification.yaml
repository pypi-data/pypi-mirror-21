# *** Syntax inspirations ***
# Docker Compose file:  https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/
# Ansible Playbooks:    https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/YAMLSyntax.html

# *** Labels for syntactic components ***
# Children do not have to be specified if parent is not defined
# If no label is given, then context will determine label (Everything should be labeled eventually)
#
# REQUIRED      These must be defined. Not doing so is an parse-time error.
# Suggested     These should be defined. Not doing so will result in a parse-time warning.
# Optional      Do not have to be specified.
# Option X      One of the options specified at that level of nesting must be defined. Not doing so is a parse-time error.

# *** Definitions ***
# VM    Virtual Machine
# AD    Active Directory
# CIDR  Classless Inter-Domain Routing, a concise format for representing subnet masks (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632)
# YAML  Yaml Ain't Markup Language, a file format syntax (http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/)
# JSON  JavaScript Object Notation, a file format syntax (http://www.json.org/)

# *** Notes ***
# "Instances" is assumed to be one unless specified otherwise. They cannot be negative or zero
# Top-level definitions are only required if used (e.g resources, groups, networks)
# Details on exercise environment creation steps ("phases") can be found in the description for folders

# ### Beginning of Specification ###

# ** Document Metadata **
metadata:
  name: "name"                # REQUIRED    Human-readable title for the specification
  description: "description"  # Suggested   Human-readable detailed description of the specification
  activity: "the activity"    # Optional    The activity the specification is being used for, e.g "CS 439" or "PRCCDC"
  prefix: "GLOBAL-PREFIX"     # REQUIRED    Globally unique prefix that distinguishes this exercise's environments from others on the same infrastructure
  date-created: "date"        # Optional    UTC format: YYYY-MM-DD (Example: 2016-10-12)
  version: "0.0.0"            # Suggested   Semantic version of the document: major.minor.bugfix
  infrastructure-config-file: "filename.yaml" # REQUIRED    YAML file specifying the infrastructure used to create the exercise environment (See: infrastructure-specification.yaml for syntax)
  folder-name: "/Path/To/Folder-Name"         # Suggested   Path of the folder that will contain the exercise, relative to root defined in the infrastructure configuration


# ** Groups/Teams **
# User groups, such as teams, students, instructors, etc
# These are used to apply permissions to the resources and machines in the generated virtual exercise environment
groups:
  Group Regular Example:
    # The three different methods of specifying users for a regular group
    ad-group: "Users"       # Option A  AD group must exist
    filename: "a-file.json" # Option B  File format: specifications/user-json-specification.json
    user-list: [ "user-a", "user-b" ] # Option C  List of usernames

  # For creating batch groups from a common template base, the "template" type can be used
  Group Template Example:
    instances: 10           # REQUIRED  Number of groups created from this template. This marks a group as a template.
    ad-group: "Group [X]"   # Option A  '[X]' is the instance number. AD group must exist  
    filename: "users.json"  # Option B  File format: specifications/user-json-specification.json


# ** Services **
# Definition of services (nodes) that will be created in the exercise environment, such as hosts, servers, and routers
# Case insensitive EXCEPT for resources, such as templates or images
# Networks are attached to interfaces in order of their definition, unless explicitly mapped
# If containers are used, a GitLab server or Docker registry MUST be specified in the infrastructure-config file
# Three types of services: template, container, compose
# template:     Templatized VM in vSphere
# container:    Docker container
# compose:      Docker Compose file
services:
  all-service-types:  # Configurations that can appear in any of three service types
    note: "A note"          # Optional    Human-readable note visible by end-user, such as default username/password
    network-interfaces: []  # Optional    List of network interfaces and their optional configurations  [default: template or container specific]
  template-based-service:   # Option A
    template: "name of template"  # REQUIRED
    template-config:      # Optional    Configuration of Template settings using key-value pairs
      key: "value"
    guest-extensions: no  # Optional    Guest extensions will be installed or enabled (e.g VMware Tools)
  container-based-service:  # Option B
    image: "name of docker image" # REQUIRED
    tag: "tag for the image"      # Optional    [default: "default"]
  compose-based-service:    # Option C
    compose-file: "filename.yml"  # REQUIRED


# ** Resources **
# Cyber-physical resources that are to be utilized. These will be attached to folders, networks, or groups as needed
# Examples: A wireless testbed or SCADA testbed in RADICL, a transformer in the power lab. 
resources:
  resource-p:
    lab: "power-lab"          # REQUIRED    Name of the lab the resource is associated with
    resource: "transformer"   # REQUIRED    Name of the specific resource


# ** Networks **
# Layer 2/3 virtual networking
# Non-Private (RFC 1918) networks will result in a warning
# Subnet IP addresses are not required. This will be utilized in future versions to configure hosts and routers.
# IP version is implicitly defined by address
# Configurations are almost same for all networks, including unique, generic, and base
# Generic and Base networks do not allow the VLAN tag to be specified
networks: 
  unique-networks:    # Only one of each of these exists. If specified, any hosts will be added to it
    network-label:                # REQUIRED    Unique label used to identify the network (Example: ARP-LAN) (Used for PortGroups in VMware environments)
      description: "description"  # Optional    Human-readable description of network
      subnet: "x.x.x.x/x"         # Suggested   IP network address and mask: SUBNET-IP/CIDR   
      vlan: 0                     # Optional    VLAN tag of the network. Must be a value < 2000. [default: globally unique value > 2000]
      vswitch: "vswitch name"     # Optional    Name of virtual switch used for the network (Applies to VMware and related environments)
  generic-networks:   # New identical instances are created per base folder instance (subnet doesn't change)
    network-label:
      description: "description"
      subnet: "x.x.x.x/x"
      vswitch: "vswitch name"
  base-networks:      # Subnet value is incremented per base folder instance
    network-label:
      description: "description"
      subnet: "x.x.x.x/x"
      vswitch: "vswitch name"


# ** Folders **
# Assemblages of objects in a hierarchical structure
# PHASES - Usually, there are two phases to creation of an exercise environment
#   Mastering     "Master" instances are created and configured by humans
#   Deployment    Full deployment of envrionment, using the Master instances created in the Mastering phase
# PERMISSIONS - Permissions are applied hierarchically, so groups with permissions to parents have permissions to children
folders:
  parent-folder:  # Folders that contain other folders
    group: group-label          # Optional    User group that will have permissions to the folder
    master-group: group-label   # Optional    User group for the pre-deployment masters [default: group specified for the folder]

        size-of: group-label  # OPTION B    Number of instances = Size of named group
        prefix: "prefix"      # Optional    String to prepend to named instance numbers [default: name of folder]
