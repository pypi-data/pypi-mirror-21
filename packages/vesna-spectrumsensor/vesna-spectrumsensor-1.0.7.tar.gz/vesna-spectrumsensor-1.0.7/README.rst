Introduction
============

This Python module abstracts the serial line protocol used by the VESNA
spectrum sensor application and provides a high-level object-oriented
Python interface.


Installation
============

To install system-wide from the package index, run::

   $ pip install vesna-spectrumsensor

To install system-wide from source, run::

   $ pip install .

To run provided unit tests, run::

   $ tox


Usage
=====

The minimal application using this module looks like the following::

   # instantiate the SpectrumSensor class using the path
   # to the serial device.
   spectrumsensor = SpectrumSensor("/dev/ttyUSB0")

   # query the attached hardware for supported configurations.
   config_list = spectrumsensor.get_config_list()

   # get required frequency sweep configuration.
   sweep_config = config_list.get_sweep_config(...)

   # define callback function that does something with
   # measurements.
   def callback(sweep_config, sweep):
      ...

   # start spectrum sensing
   spectrumsensor.run(sweep_config, callback)

Please refer to docstring documentation for details.

The package also installs vesna_rftest script that performs a series of
automated hardware tests using a USBTMC attached RF signal generator. Run
"vesna_rftest --help" to get a list of available options.
