Fake Raspberry Pi
====================

**Why??**

I do a lot of development on my Powerbook and I got tired of constantly creating
a fake interface for dev on my laptop and testing on Travis.ci.

2017 Apr 2: **Beta Quality**

Install
---------

The preferred way to install this is::

	pip install fake_rpi


Development
-------------

To submit pull requests and do development::

	git clone
	cd fake_rpi
	pip install -e .

Usage
-------

To use as is:

.. code-block:: python

	from fake_rpi import GPIO as io
	from fake_rpi import smbus

	io.setmode(io.BCM)
	b = io.input(21)

	sm = smbus.SMBus(1)
	b = sm.read_byte_data(0x21, 0x32)  # read in a byte

But I need ``smbus`` to return a specific byte for unit testing:

.. code-block:: python

	from fake_rpi import smbus
	from fake_rpi import printf

	class MyBus(smbus.SMBus):
		@printf
		def read_byte_data(self, i2c_addr, register):
			ret = 0xff
			if i2c_addr == 0x21:
				ret = 0x55
			elif i2c_addr == 0x25:
				ret = 0x11
			return ret

	sm = MyBus()
	b = sm.read_byte_data(0x21, 0x32)  # read in a byte


ToDo
-------

- add serial
- double check interfaces and flush them out better
