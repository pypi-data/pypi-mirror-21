Description: WSHubsAPI
        =========
        
        The package helps you handle complex communications in a server/clients architecture.
        
        Forget to handle web-socket messages with huge switch cases or maintain url strings for your API-REST.
        Just **call server functions from the client** and **call client function from the server** like it is the same program.
        But not only that! with this package you will be able to communicate client applications with different languages or communication protocols at the same time!
        
        Available coding languages:
        ---------------------------
        * Server side:
           * only python
        * Client side:
           * python
           * javascript
           * java/android (on going)
           * c++/arduino (on going)
           * micro-python (planned)
        
        Communication protocols
        -----------------------
        This package is mainly a message handler so it doesn't matter which communication protocol you use as long as you create a Wrapper to handle it. However, we provide handlers to start coding right away :)
        
        * Web-Sockets for tornado and ws4py
        * Http requests for Django and tornado frameworks (of course we lose server to client communication)
        * Socket
        
        **Of course, any contribution will be more that appreciated ;)**
