Rush
====

This python module is for making simple tools that rush a resource, such
as an API endpoint or web UI. This runs with both Python 2.6+ or 3.0+.

This was originally created to test the throttling of authentication
attempts. It is quite basic, but was enough to get good results from a
Django based web app. I imagine that this is good enough to indicate if
rate limiting is reasonably implemented on faster systems (more likely
to come down to network?).

Example
-------

This example attempts to connect to an API endpoint which will throttle
after 10 requests:

.. code:: python

    try:
        # Python 2
        from xmlrpclib import ServerProxy, Fault
    except ImportError:
        # Python 3
        from xmlrpc.client import ServerProxy, Fault

    from rush import Rusher


    def api_auth_tester(index, thread_count):
        """
        Rush the API with invalid authentication attempts.
        """
        # prepare the worker
        proxy = ServerProxy('https://badname:supersecretpassword@api.memset.com/v1/xmlrpc/')
        yield  # yield to indicate that the worker is ready to rush
        # rush
        try:
            proxy.server.list()
        except Fault as error:
            # yield a string indicating the result
            if error.faultCode == 4:  # bad username/pass
                yield 'attempted'
            elif error.faultCode == 12:  # throttled
                yield 'throttled'

    print("API rate limiting test:")
    # the API will throttle after 10 requests, so make 9 requests first, then rush two calls
    rusher = Rusher(api_auth_tester, 9)
    # preform the first 9 requests so the next request should set a throttling indicator
    duration, results = rusher.rush_and_report()
    # change the number of threads we want to make
    rusher.thread_count = 2
    # only one call should not be throttled
    rusher.rush_and_report()

This will produce output like the following:

::

    API rate limiting test:
    9 threads completed in .747115, results:
        attempted: 9
    2 threads completed in .127208, results:
        attempted: 1
        throttled: 1
