Introduction
============
The module is a massively parallel implementation of the Trotter-Suzuki approximation to simulate the evolution of quantum systems classically.  It relies on interfacing with C++ code with OpenMP for multicore execution, and it can be accelerated by CUDA.

Key features of the Python interface:

* Simulation of 1D and 2D quantum systems.
* Cartesian and cylindrical coordinate systems.
* Fast execution by parallelization: OpenMP and CUDA are supported.
* Many-body simulations with non-interacting particles.
* Solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation  (e.g., `dark solitons <https://github.com/Lucacalderaro/Master-Thesis/blob/master/Soliton%20generation%20on%20Bose-Einstein%20Condensate.ipynb>`_, `vortex dynamics in Bose-Einstein Condensates <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/trotter-suzuki-mpi/notebooks/blob/master/Vortex_Dynamics.ipynb>`_).
* Imaginary time evolution to approximate the ground state.
* Stationary and time-dependent external potential.
* NumPy arrays are supported for efficient data exchange.
* Multi-platform: Linux, OS X, and Windows are supported.
