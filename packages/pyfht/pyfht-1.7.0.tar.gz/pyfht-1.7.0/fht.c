/* Taps for maximal-length LFSRs of 0 to 32 bits length.
 * These particular taps are the largest taps from:
 * http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/lfsr/index.html
 * that have the maximal number of bits set (i.e., the largest number of taps)
 * for any set in that size of LFSR.
 * This special property ensures we get fewer runs of decreasing powers of two
 * caused by single bits being mostly unchanged as they traverse large runs
 * without taps, which selects for rows of the Hadamard matrix which have
 * powers-of-two indices, which tend to be highly structured with relation to
 * each other.
 *
 * From the compressed files on the site above, we can find the taps to use for
 * all n>4 (for n<4, use 0, 0, 3, 6):
 *
 * rustc -O findmaxtaps.rs
 * for f in *.dat.gz;
 *    gunzip -c $f | findmaxtaps;
 * end
 *
 *
 * Why use LFSRs?
 * 
 * We want all numbers between 1 and N (where N is the power-of-two size of the
 * Hadamard matrix we're using) to be equally likely, in a random sequence with
 * no repeats (until the entire sequence repeats). We specifically don't want 0
 * (as the 0th row of a Hadamard matrix is all-1s and a very poor choice
 * always) and we cannot afford repeats (we must select a subset of the rows
 * that has cardinality n).
 * 
 * With a normal random number generator we get random numbers with repeats
 * over a huge range. So we'd need to exclude 0s and keep track of which
 * numbers we've already seen, plus it's slower.
 *
 * A suitable LFSR will generate every number of that bit width exactly once
 * before repeating, and will never generate 0 (unless it starts at 0). This
 * makes them very suited to this application. However if we use a minimal
 * number of taps (the usual desire), we obtain sequences where a single 1 is
 * shifted through the register without being flipped, causing sequences of
 * powers of two: 128->64->32->16->8 etc. This is a particularly poor choice of
 * sampling from the Hadamard matrix (it results in a new matrix which still
 * has high levels of structure) so we deliberately pick taps with as many bits
 * set as possible, to ensure as much bit flipping as possible.
