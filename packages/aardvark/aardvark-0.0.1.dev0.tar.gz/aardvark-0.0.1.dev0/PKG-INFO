Description: # Aardvark is a multi-account AWS IAM Access Advisor API
        
        # Install:
        
            pip install aardvark
        
        The phantomjs executable must be downloaded from http://phantomjs.org/download.html
        
        ## Configure Aardvark
        
        The Aardvark config wizard will guide you through the setup.
        - List of AWS Accounts, their names and identifiers.
        - The name of the IAM Role to assume into in each account.
        - The Database connection string.
        - Location of the PhantomJS executable.
        ```
            aardvark config
        ```
        
        ## IAM Permissions:
        
        Aardvark needs an IAM Role in each account that will be queried.  Additionally, Aardvark needs to be launched with a role or user which can `sts:AssumeRole` into the different account roles.
        
        AardvarkInstanceProfile:
        - Only create one.
        - Needs the ability to call `sts:AssumeRole` into all of the AardvarkRole's
        
        AardvarkRole:
        - Must exist in every account to be monitored.
        - Must have a trust policy allowing `AardvarkInstanceProfile`.
        - Has these permissions:
        ```
        iam:GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails
        iam:GetServiceLastAccessedDetails
        iam:listrolepolicies
        iam:listroles
        ```
        
        So if you are monitoring `n` accounts, you will always need `n+1` roles. (`n` AardvarkRoles and `1` AardvarkInstanceProfile).
        
        ## Gather Access Advisor Data
        
            aardvark update
        
        or
        
            aardvark update -a dev,test,prod
        
        ## Caveats:
        
        Aardvark is currently single threaded.  To pass the ARNs to phantomJS, and read the advisor results, files are written with non-unique names.
