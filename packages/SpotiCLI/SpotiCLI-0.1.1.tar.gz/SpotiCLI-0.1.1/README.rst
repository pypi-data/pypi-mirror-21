SpotiCLI
========

SpotiCLI is a simple command line interface for Spotify. Keep control of
your music from the comfort of your terminal!

A quick rundown:
----------------

-  song control: *play, pause, prev,* and *next* song
-  search and quickplay best matching *song, artist,* or *album* (I'm
   feeling lucky!)
-  search and choose best matching *song, artist,* or *album* from
   results list

For Spotify free users, ads will stay play when navigating through
songs. ***Oh boy!***

**Currently Python 3 and Linux/Unix only.**
