        PyPond - Python Pond timeseries library.
        ========================================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        PyPond is a Python implementation of the JavaScript `Pond timeseries
        library <http://software.es.net/pond/>`__. At a very high level, both
        implementations offer classes and structures to collect, manipulate and
        transmit timeseries data. Time series transmission is done via a
        JSON-based wire format.
        
        This implementation is `available on
        GitHub <https://github.com/esnet/pypond>`__ and the API documentation is
        available at `software.es.net <http://software.es.net/pypond/>`__ (and
        alternately on `RTD <http://pypond.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__).
        
        PyPond runs on python 2.7 and 3.3 through 3.6.
        
        Core Documentation
        ------------------
        
        The `main project site <http://software.es.net/pond/>`__ has extensive
        documentation on the various structures (Event, TimeRange, TimeSeries,
        etc) that both implementations use internally. There is no need to
        duplicate that conceptual documentation here since the python
        implementation follows the same API and uses the same structures.
        
        The only real difference with pypond is that the method names have been
        changed to their obvious pythonic corollaries (``obj.toString()``
        becomes ``obj.to_string()``) and any comparison methods named ``.is()``
        in the JavaScript version have been renamed to ``.same()`` in pypond
        since ``is`` is a reserved word in python.
        
        The `tests <https://github.com/esnet/pypond/tree/master/tests>`__ can
        also be referred to as a fairly complete set of examples as well.
