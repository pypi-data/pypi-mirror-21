        consistent robust pypi-cache
        ----------------------------------------
        
        You can point ``pip or easy_install`` to the ``root/pypi/+simple/``
        index, serving as a self-updating transparent cache for pypi-hosted
        **and** external packages.  Cache-invalidation uses the latest and
        greatest PyPI protocols.  The cache index continues to serve when
        offline and will resume cache-updates once network is available.
        
        user specific indexes
        ---------------------
        
        Each user (which can represent a person or a project, team) can have
        multiple indexes and upload packages and docs via standard ``setup.py``
        invocations command.  Users and indexes can be manipulated through a
        RESTful HTTP API.
        
        index inheritance
        --------------------------
        
        Each index can be configured to merge in other indexes so that it serves
        both its uploads and all releases from other index(es).  For example, an
        index using ``root/pypi`` as a parent is a good place to test out a
        release candidate before you push it to PyPI.
        
        good defaults and easy deployment
        ---------------------------------------
        
        Get started easily and create a permanent devpi-server deployment
        including pre-configured templates for ``nginx`` and cron. 
        
        separate tool for Packaging/Testing activities
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        The complimentary `devpi-client <http://pypi.python.org/devpi-client>`_ tool
        helps to manage users, indexes, logins and typical setup.py-based upload and
        installation workflows.
        
        See http://doc.devpi.net for getting started and documentation.
        
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        4.3.0 (2017-04-23)
        ------------------
        
        - allow upload of documentation without first registering the project or
          uploading releases.
        
        - add a new command line option ``--replica-max-retries``
        
          Under certain network conditions, it's possible for a connection from devpi
          to replicas (such as pypi) to be dropped, resulting in a 502 bad gateway
          being returned from devpi. When replica-max-retries is set to a number > 0,
          devpi will attempt to retry connections until the retry limit is reached.
        
        - fix ``--import`` after ``--init`` option was added.
        
        - fix import when the export contains a bases cycle.
        
        - fix issue350: use absolute path to devpi-server when starting
          background process.
        
        - fix issue392: setting user password from command line when password hash
          wasn't migrated yet failed.
        
        - fix #381: indicate acceptable exit status for systemd.
        
        - remove broken ``--bypass-cdn`` option.
        
        
        4.2.1 (2016-12-22)
        ------------------
        
        - the new ``--init`` option now exits after done, so it can be used in
          automation scripts. When using with ``--start`` it still starts the
          background server immediately.
        
        
        4.2.0 (2016-12-14)
        ------------------
        
        SECURITY NOTE:
        
        Before devpi-server 4.2.0 passwords were hashed with a very weak algorithm.
        It's strongly recommended to change any passwords created before 4.2.0
        after upgrading! The password salt and hashes are exposed via the /+changelog
        URL used for replication. If you use replication you should use client
        side certificates or https with basic authentication to secure /+changelog.
        
        UPGRADE NOTE:
        
        Starting with devpi-server 4.2.0 the replication protocol is disabled by
        default to prevent accidental information leaks, like password hashes. To
        enable the replication protocol, you have to use ``--role master`` when
        starting the master devpi-server instance.
        
        - fix issue378: the replication protocol is now disabled by default.
        
        - fix push to PyPI by skipping failing "register" step and adding additional
          fields in POST data on "file_upload".
        
        - fix issue372: correctly set isolation_level for sqlite3 connections. This
          also fixes Python 3.6 compatibility.
        
        - fix issue334: The event handler for the simple page cache failed when an
          index was deleted and a new replica tried to run the event hooks.
        
        - fix issue314: Fetch external file on replica from original source if master
          is down.
        
        - fix issue363: Replace weak password hashing with argon2 using passlib.
          Existing logins will be migrated on login.
        
        - fix issue377: Add new ``--init`` option required to initialize a server
          directory. This prevents accidental use of wrong or empty ``--serverdir``.
        
        - fix issue285: require waitress >= 1.0.1 to enable IPv6 support.
        
        
        4.1.1 (2016-10-14)
        ------------------
        
        - when a project has no releases (only setup.py register ran) and it isn't
          whitelisted, then upstream releases will now be blocked as expected.
        
        - Adjust event processing status messages and the times when they are shown:
          After 5 minutes of no event processing there will be a warning.
          After 30 minutes this will turn into a fatal status.
          After 1 hour of not being in sync there will be a warning.
          After 6 hours of desync the status turns fatal.
        
        - handle sqlite3.NotSupportedError when the installed sqlite doesn't support
          URI filenames at all.
        
        
        4.1.0 (2016-07-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Try opening read only transactions in SQLite read only mode for better
          concurrency/locking behaviour. This is officially supported with Python 3.4,
          but many systems allow it implicitly in older Python versions.
        
        - fix issue353: If an index inherits from a mirror with an empty cache and the
          mirror is returning errors, there would be an error returned by devpi. Now
          this situation is treated like the mirror has no releases and just the
          releases from the index are returned.
        
        - fix issue352: When there was an issue during commit or rollback, the thread
          local info got into an inconsistent state. This caused an AttributeError
          whenever that thread was used. Eventually this could exhaust all worker
          threads and make devpi unresponsive.
        
        - fix issue354: allow more general agent versions, such as 'Python-urllib/3.5'
          to appear before the installer user agent string so redirects for setuptools
          versions which had that work.
        
        - fix issue214: change the order in which indices are searched to fix the
          mirror whitelisting and also make sure that packages, if available,
          are always installed from internal indices instead of root/pypi.
