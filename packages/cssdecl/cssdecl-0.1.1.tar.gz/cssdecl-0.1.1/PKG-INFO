Description: # `cssdecl` Python CSS declaration computer
        
        This package provides basic computation of CSS declarations in order to:
        
        * handle overwriting of properties
        * expand shorthands like `border-width: 0 5px` into `border-top-width: 0`, `border-right-width: 5px`, `border-bottom-width: 0`, `border-left-width: 5px`
        * (TODO!) expand shorthands like `font: 5px sans-serif bold` into `font-family: sans-serif`, `font-size: 5px`, `font-weight: bold`
        * resolve sizes to a common unit (i.e. pt)
        * resolve `inherit` given some inherited declarations
        
        It does not process CSS selectors and their applicability to elements, including specificity.
        
        Some properties that are not shorthands in CSS 2.2 become
        shorthands in CSS 3, such as `text-decoration`. We therefore
        hope to provide CSS22Resolver and CSS3Resolver.
        
        
        This was first developed for use in [Pandas](pandas.pydata.org) ([#15530](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/15530)).
        Issues will continue to be prioritised to improve CSS support there, in the absence of other clear use-cases.
