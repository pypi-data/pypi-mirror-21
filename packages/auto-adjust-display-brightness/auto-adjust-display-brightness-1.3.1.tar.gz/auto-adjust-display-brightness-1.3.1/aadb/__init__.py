"""
Usage: auto-adjust-display-brightness [OPTIONS]

Automatically adjust the display brightness of Linux displays.

If the system booted less than five minutes ago the display brightness is
adjusted in a single step. After five minutes of uptime the brightness is
adjusted in steps of 10% (unless --force is given).

Supports back light brightness control using the Linux `/sys/class/backlight'
interface as well as fall back to software brightness control using `xrandr'.

Supported options:

  -f, --force

    Adjust the display brightness in one step regardless of uptime.

  -v, --verbose

    Make more noise (increase logging verbosity).

  -q, --quiet

    Make less noise (decrease logging verbosity).

  -h, --help

    Show this message and exit.
