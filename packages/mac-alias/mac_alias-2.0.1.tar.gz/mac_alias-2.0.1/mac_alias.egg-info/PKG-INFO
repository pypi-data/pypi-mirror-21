Description: ``mac_alias`` lets you generate or read binary Alias and Bookmark records
        from Python code.
        
        While it is written in pure Python, some OS X specific code is required to
        generate a proper Alias or Bookmark record for a given file, so this module
        currently is not portable to other platforms.
        
        Credit is due to Wim Lewis <wiml@hhhh.org>, whose work on reverse engineering
        the alias format was extremely useful in writing this code.  Alastair Houghton
        <alastair@alastairs-place.net> was responsible for reverse engineering the
        bookmark format.
