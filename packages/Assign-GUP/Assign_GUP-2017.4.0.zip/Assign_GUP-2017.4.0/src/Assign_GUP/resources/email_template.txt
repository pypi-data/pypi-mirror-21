subject: APS General User Proposal Review Assignments for REVIEW_CYCLE Cycle
CC: Beverly Knott <bevknott@aps.anl.gov>


FULL_NAME:

It is time again to review the APS small-angle scattering proposals
for the REVIEW_CYCLE schedule cycle.  The APS is indebted to you
for your willingness and diligence in reviewing these proposals.

Here are your assigned proposals:

primary
ASSIGNED_PRIMARY_PROPOSALS

secondary
ASSIGNED_SECONDARY_PROPOSALS


(Let me know if there is a discrepancy between what is
listed above and what appears in the on-line system.)

If you find a couple of proposals that are off your "comfort zone,"
that is my attempting to strike a balance between comfort and number of
proposals per reviewer.  Let me know if I have missed the mark completely.

This is a reminder that the next Proposal Review Panel Meeting is scheduled 
PRP_DATE.  The APS User Office will be sending
you an email describing when and where we shall meet on that day.

    (http://www.aps.anl.gov/Users/Calendars/GUP_Calendar.htm)

    
You can find a detailed description of the responsibilities
of Proposal Review Panel members at:

http://www.aps.anl.gov/user/beamtime/prp_instructions.html#responsibilities


Here is the basic template I use to help in our discussion on
the review date. Paste this in to the WWW-based review form if you
don't find it there already. If you are reviewer one, paste your 
comments above reviewer two.  As a cross-check, since we sometimes 
catch the comments pasted into the wrong proposal, replace the #### 
with the proposal number.  Then, please enter your remarks under the
appropriate reviewer.  In the course of our discussion, we'll edit to
show our final consensus and remove individual remarks.

Please enter your reviews for the proposals on which you are either
primary or secondary reviewer into the online system.  However,
guarding against system failures, it's a great idea to email me a file with
your reviews as well.  Be sure to comment on the proposal, give a score
(1=best possible, 5=no possible relation between proposed science and
proposal, averages are typically 1.8-2.0), and also a recommended
number of shifts (both for this cycle and for the 2-year life of the proposal).

Thanks again for your participation and help in
advancing the science at the APS.

Look forward to seeing you soon,
