Description: A large collection of Python3 equations that perform curve fitting on 2D and 3D data, output source code in several computing languages, and run a genetic algorithm for initial parameter estimation. Comes with cluster, parallel, IPython, GUI, NodeJS, and web-based graphical examples. Includes orthogonal distance and relative error regressions.
