# THE CITY ENERGY ANALYST

## Quick tour

The city energy analyst (CEA) is an urban simulation engine created to assess multiple energy efficiency strategies in urban areas. The CEA offers tools for the analysis of the carbon, financial and environmental benefits of the next strategies in an urban area:

1. **Building retrofits**: Appliances and lighting, building envelope, HVAC systems (incl. Control strategies)
2. **Integration of local energy sources**: renewable and waste-to-heat energy sources.
3. **Infrastructure retrofits**: decentralized and centralized thermal micro-grids and conversion technologies.
4. **Modifications to urban form**: new zoning, changes in occupancy and building typology.

## Documentation and style guide

Documentation is still a work-in-progress and is available in [here](https://architecture-building-systems.gitbooks.io/cea-toolbox-for-arcgis-manual/content/).
