        --------
        
        CLOI is an open-sourced project from the Engineers at [Xtralien](http://xtralien.com)
        to help support easy scientific research, but it was designed to be simple, and work in
        quite a lot of scenarios.
        
        
        Design Goals
        ------------
        
        You can read more about CLOI on the [Xtralien website](http://xtralien.com) but essentially it was designed with the
        goal of being easy to extend.
        To this end, from a technical standpoint it is easy to add more functionality to CLOI, which is as simple as writing
        a function and attaching the function to CLOI.
        From an end-user standpoint it is also easy to use, with the main interface being text, as if you were typing commands
        into a terminal.
