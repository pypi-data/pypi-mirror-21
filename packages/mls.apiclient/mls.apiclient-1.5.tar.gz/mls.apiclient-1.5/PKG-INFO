        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Add ``mls.apiclient`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
             [buildout]
             ...
             eggs =
                 ...
                 mls.apiclient
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
             $ ./bin/buildout
