Description: yarntf
        ======
        
        ``yarntf`` simplifies the distributed TensorFlow programming model, for running
        machine learning applications on Hadoop YARN clusters.
        
        User Guide
        ----------
        
        In general it is as simple as follows.
        
        1. In your code: replace ``tf.train.ClusterSpec()`` and ``tf.train.Server()`` with ``yarntf.createClusterServer()``
        2. On your cluster: submit the application with `hops-tensorflow <https://github.com/hopshadoop/hops-tensorflow>`_
        
        Your ClusterSpec is generated automaticaly and the parameter servers stopped when all workers are completed. Specify the number of worker, ps and resources on submit.
        
        For more details see the examples.
