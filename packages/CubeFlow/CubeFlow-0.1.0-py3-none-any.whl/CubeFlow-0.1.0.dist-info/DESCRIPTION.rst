CubeFlow
========

:abstract: CubeFlow is a Python framework to easily build and analyse grid based simulation such as heat transportation
    or fluid dynamics. CubeFlow aims to provide an easy implementation without the need of writing code other than
    the one needed for the actual simulation. CubeFlow is not a super fast simulator but focuses primarily on
    educational purposes.
