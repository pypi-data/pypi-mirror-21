Description: Integrate first-order ODE systems  u'(t) = f(u, t).
        
        The main feature of this library is dG(q), i.e. the
        time-discontinuous Galerkin method using a Lobatto basis
        (a.k.a. hierarchical polynomial basis).
        
        dG(q) is a very accurate implicit method that often allows
        using a rather large timestep. Due to its Galerkin nature,
        it also allows inspecting the behavior of the solution
        inside the timestep.
        
        Arbitrary q is supported, but often best results are
        obtained for q=1 or q=2.
        
        Some classical integrators (RK2, RK3, RK4, IMR, BE)
        are also provided for convenience.
        
        The focus is on arbitrary nonlinear problems; all implicit
        methods are implemented using fixed-point (Banach/Picard)
        iteration.
