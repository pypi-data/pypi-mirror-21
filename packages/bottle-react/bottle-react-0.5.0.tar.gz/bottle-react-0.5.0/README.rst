Bottle-React
============

***NOW SUPPORTS FLASK!*** See
`examples/hello\_world/run\_flask.py <examples/hello_world/run_flask.py>`__.

Description
-----------

This library allows you to return react components from either Bottle or
Flask. It currently powers https://www.hvst.com/.

Example (Hello World)
---------------------

Assume you have a normal JSX file ``hello_world.jsx``:

.. code:: js

    var HelloWorld = React.createClass({
      render: function() {
        return (
          <div className='hello_world'>
            <h1>Hello {this.props.name}!</h1>
            <div>
              Thanks for trying bottle-react!
            </div>
          </div>
        );
      }
    })
    bottlereact._register('HelloWorld', HelloWorld)

And some python code:

.. code:: python

    app = bottle.Bottle()
    br = BottleReact(app)

    @app.get('/')
    def root():
      return br.render_html(
        br.HelloWorld({'name':'World'})
      )

When your route is called the react component will be rendered. See
`examples/hello\_world <examples/hello_world>`__ for details.

Principles
----------

Why did we develop this? We had several goals:

-  [x] Don't cross-compile javascript during development.

Compiling with ``webpack`` is too slow for non-trivial applications.
(One of the niceties about web developement it ``alt-Tab``/``ctrl-R`` to
see your changes.) And it causes too many subtle bugs between dev and
prod that waste developer resources.

-  [x] Don't merge all javascript into one ginormous bundle.

Making your user download a 1.5Mb ``kitchensink.min.js`` every
deployment is horrible. And 99% of it isn't used on most pages. Loading
40kb total from multiple resources with HTTP keep-alive takes just a few
ms per file and is much faster in practice.

-  [x] React components should be composable from Python.

A lot of our routes look like this:

.. code:: python

    @app.get('/something')
    def something():
      user = bottle.request.current_user
      return br.render_html(
        br.HvstApp({'user':user.to_dict()}, [
          br.HelloWorld({'name':user.name}),
        ])
      )

The React component ``HvstApp`` (which renders the title bar and left
nav) is taking two parameters. The first is a ``dict`` that will be
passed as the JSON props to the React component. The second is a
``list`` that will become the children. This list can (and usually does)
contain other React components.

Install
-------

.. code:: python

    sudo pip install bottle-react

NGINX Integration
-----------------

By default (in production mode) ``bottle-react`` writes to
``/tmp/bottlereact/hashed-assets/``. To make NGINX serve these files
directly, use the following:

::

      location ^~ /__br_assets__/ {
        alias /tmp/bottlereact/hashed-assets/;
        expires max;
      }
