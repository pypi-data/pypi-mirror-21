Donation Recurring
==================

This module handles recurring donations. For example, if you have
setup a donation plan where donors can donate monthly via direct
debit, you can use this module in combination with the module
*account_banking_sepa_direct_debit* to organise your recurring donations
(and you may also use the module *account_direct_debit*).

Configuration
=============

In the menu Donations > Donations > Recurring Donations, create a
recurring donation template for each donor that commited to donate
monthly via direct debit.

Usage
=====

Every month, execute the wizard *Generate Recurring Donations* : it will
duplicate each recurring donation template to create a regular donation.
Then select all these new draft donations generated by the wizard and
validate them.
