			
Overview
========
	  
PTML is a Python module which lets you embed Python code in text
documents.  Its most common application is dynamic content generation
on web servers, however it can be used anywhere you need to generate
text files on-the-fly.

The project is still at a very early stage, although the code should
be usable enough for you to learn the syntax and experiment with
possible applications.  Future directions are briefly listed in the
TODO file, suggestions and contributions are most welcome.

PTML is hosted by those wonderful people at SourceForge, the homepage
is http://ptml.sourceforge.net.  You can create and track bugs, join
the mailing lists and access the CVS repository from the project
information page at http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=5811

Installation and developer's documentation is still very sparse,
partially because I haven't had time to comprehensively document
everything and partially because documentation would become obsolete
very quickly at this stage of development.  Future releases should
improve the situation.
