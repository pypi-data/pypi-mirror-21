Magento Connector - Pricing
===========================

Extension for **Magento Connector**.

The prices of the products are managed in OpenERP using pricelists and
are pushed to Magento.

Installation
============

This module installs on top of the the **Magento Connector**

Configuration and usage
=======================

Read http://odoo-magento-connector.com/howto/configure_pricing.html

Limitations
===========

* The 'Catalog Price Scope' option on Magento must be set to 'Website'
* The prices are exported when they are changed directly on the product,
  not when they are changed on the pricelist (so it works well when the
  pricelists are based on the price filed on the product, such as a
  percent, but does not work when the pricelists have fixed prices)
