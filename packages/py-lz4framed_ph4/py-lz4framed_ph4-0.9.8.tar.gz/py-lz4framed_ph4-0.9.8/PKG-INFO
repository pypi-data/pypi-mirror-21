Description: Overview
        ========
        
        This is an `LZ4 <http://lz4.org>`__-frame compression library for Python
        v3.2+ (and 2.7+), bound to Yann Collet's `LZ4 C
        implementation <https://github.com/lz4/lz4>`__.
        
        Installing / packaging
        ======================
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            # To get from PyPI
            pip3 install py-lz4framed_ph4
        
            # To only build extension modules inline (e.g. in repository)
            python3 setup.py build_ext -i
        
            # To build & install globally
            python3 setup.py install
        
            # To install locally with pip
            pip install --upgrade --find-links=. .
        
        **Notes**
        
        -  The above as well as all other python3-using commands should also run
           with v2.7+
        -  This fork is based on https://github.com/Iotic-Labs/py-lz4framed
        
        Improvements
        ============
        
        This fork has several improvements I needed for my other project.
        
        -  Streamed decompression continuation (on reconnect)
        -  Streamed decompression state clone - checkpointing
        -  Streamed decompression marshalling - failure recovery
        
        More on improvements
        --------------------
        
        The scenario improvements address is downloading & decompressing large
        LZ4 data stream on the fly (hundreds of GBs). If the download stream is
        interrupted the original decompressor had no way to resume the
        decompression where it stopped.
        
        Continuation
        ------------
        
        The main motivation is to recover from these interruptions. Decompressor
        object now supports changing of the file-like object that is read from.
        If input socket stream went down we can re-connect and continue from the
        position it stopped. More in test ``test_decompressor_fp_continuation``.
        
        State cloning
        -------------
        
        If the processing logic is more complex you can use
        ``clone_decompression_context`` to clone decompressor context (the whole
        decompression state) and revert to this checkpoint if something breaks.
        More in test ``test_decompressor_fp_clone``.
        
        State marshalling
        -----------------
        
        In order to recover also from program crashes you can marshal /
        serialize the decompressor context to the (byte) string which can be
        later unmarshalled / deserialized and continue from that point.
        Marshalled state can be stored e.g., to a file. More in test
        ``test_decompressor_fp_marshalling``.
        
        Please note marshalled state is not fully portable between systems with
        different endianness & bit width (32 vs. 64). Most of the marshalling is
        already universal, but checksum state is just memcpy-ied. So if you
        transfer the state to a different machine and checksum is wrong, this
        might be the case.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Single-function operation:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import lz4framed
        
            compressed = lz4framed.compress(b'binary data')
        
            uncompressed = lz4framed.decompress(compressed)
        
        To iteratively compress (to a file or e.g. BytesIO instance):
        
        .. code:: python
        
            with open('myFile', 'wb') as f:
                # Context automatically finalises frame on completion, unless an exception occurs
                with Compressor(f) as c:
                    try:
                        while (...):
                           c.update(moreData)
                    except Lz4FramedNoDataError:
                        pass
        
        To decompress from a file-like object:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            with open('myFile', 'rb') as f:
                try:
                    for chunk in Decompressor(f):
                       decoded.append(chunk)
                except Lz4FramedNoDataError:
                    # Compress frame data incomplete - error case
                    ...
        
        See also `lz4framed/\_\_main\_\_.py <lz4framed/__main__.py>`__ for
        example usage.
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import lz4framed
            print(lz4framed.__version__, lz4framed.LZ4_VERSION, lz4framed.LZ4F_VERSION)
            help(lz4framed)
        
        Command-line utility
        ====================
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            python3 -mlz4framed
            USAGE: lz4framed (compress|decompress) (INFILE|-) [OUTFILE]
        
            (De)compresses an lz4 frame. Input is read from INFILE unless set to '-', in
            which case stdin is used. If OUTFILE is not specified, output goes to stdout.
        
        Tests
        =====
        
        Static
        ------
        
        This library has been checked using
        `flake8 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8>`__ and
        `pylint <http://www.pylint.org>`__, using a modified configuration - see
        *pylint.rc* and *flake8.cfg*.
        
        Unit
        ----
        
        .. code:: shell

        Why?
        ====
        
        The only existing lz4-frame interoperable implementation I was aware of
        at the time of writing
        (`lz4tools <https://github.com/darkdragn/lz4tools>`__) had the following
        limitations:
        
        -  Incomplete implementation in terms of e.g. reference & memory leaks
           on failure
        -  Lack of unit tests
        -  Not thread safe
        -  Does not release GIL during low level (de)compression operations
        -  Did not address the requirements for an external project
