        *************************
        
        This is the README for fwdpy11_, which is a Python package for forward-time population genetic simulation.  It uses
        fwdpp_ as its C++ back-end.

        Features
        -----------------------
        
        * Picklable population objects
        * Parallel computation via multiprocessing_ or concurrent.futures_.
        * Custom temporal samplers to analyze populations *during* a simulation may be written in pure Python.
          
        Dependencies
        -----------------------
        
        The following must be present on your system:
        
        * GSL_. This is a C library.  It is available via `conda`.
        * pybind11_. This should be installed via `pip` or `conda` as appropriate for your system.
        
        fwdpy11_ also uses fwdpp_, which is included as a submodule.

        Suppored Python version
        -----------------------
        
        fwdpy11 is written for Python 3.  Given time/energy, we *may* look into supporting Python 2.7.  However, it is impossible to support all fwdpy11 features in Python 2.7.  Specifically, it is not possible to provide full pickling support.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            git submodule init
            git submodule update
            python setup.py build_ext -i
            python test.py
        
        Installation
        ---------------------------------
        
        Using pip on Linux (or pip3 as appropriate for your system):
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install --upgrade fwdpy11
        
        On OS X, you must use GCC.  It is **highly** recommended that you use a GCC installed from Anaconda.  We do all of our
        OS X testing using the GCC 4.8.5 from Anaconda:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            CC=gcc CXX=g++ pip install --upgrade fwdpy11
