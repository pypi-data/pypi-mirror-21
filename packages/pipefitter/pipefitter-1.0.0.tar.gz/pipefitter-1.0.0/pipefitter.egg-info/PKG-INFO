Description: **************
        SAS Pipefitter
        **************
        
        The SAS Pipefitter project provides a Python API for developing
        machine learning pipelines. The pipelines are built from stages
        that perform variable transformation, parameter estimation, and
        hyperparameter tuning. 
        
        A key feature of pipefitter is that the pipelines can run
        with a SAS 9.4 platform as well as with SAS Cloud Analytic
        Services (CAS) in the SAS Viya platform.
        
        This package builds on the SASPy and SAS SWAT packages. Those
        packages enable Python to work with SAS 9.4 and SAS Viya,
        respectively.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        SAS pipefitter can be installed as follows with `pip`::
        
            pip install pipefitter
        
        Alternatively, you can install a specific release as follows::
        
            pip install https://github.com/sassoftware/python-pipefitter/releases/download/vX.X.X/pipefitter-X.X.X.tar.gz
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        The package is a pure Python package and works with Python 2.7 or 3.4+.
        
        However, the packages that enable Python to work with the different
        SAS platforms introduce dependencies of their own.
