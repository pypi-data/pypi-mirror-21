Django Async is an asynchronous execution queue for Django with proper
database transaction management.

Building a database backed task queue is a fairly trivial thing, but
getting the database transactions exactly right is no simple matter.

Usage and documentation
=======================

All documentation can be found at http://www.kirit.com/Django%20Async

Doing development
=================

*This project uses git flow. Don't forget to do ``git flow init -d``*

To test just run ``tox``. But if you want to go the old way then to
create virtual environments for running the tests you can execute
``test-projects/make-virtual-environments``. To run the tests execute
``runtests``.
