Syntax for defining sections (spex,act,scene,etc)

[contents]

##Name of Act

Syntax for defining characters:

%Kekkonen(K) Urho Kaleva Kekkonen
character description can have multiple paragraphs and ends with next key


What is missing:

should keys always be in the very beginning of a line? (allow indentation of headings?)
syntax for music and songs (old syntax <So, <Mu): suggestions $H Oon pääsihteeri
syntax for lyrics/poetic lines, suggestions: +K Oon Kekkoslovakian kaljupääkeisari
syntax for effects
syntax for long comments, suggestions: {}, /* */
syntax for commenting out one "block", suggestions <!K Minä olen Kekkonen!, <"K Jorma
syntax for tagged and signed comments
syntax for including files
syntax for general comments

what about leave # for comments and use another char for sections?
