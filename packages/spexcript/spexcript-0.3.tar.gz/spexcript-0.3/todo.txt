Useful Unicode chars

♩ 2669 quarter note
♪ 266A eighth note
♫ 266B beamed eighth notes
♬ 266C beamed sixteenth notes

Errors when there are no acts and scenes, but formatting tries to figure out their `numbering` (now have a crappy fix).

Should perhaps insert dummy act/scene/Section to empty scripts and make a dummy front page.

Maybe report which disallowed unicode chars were removed.
Also improve list of allowed chars.
