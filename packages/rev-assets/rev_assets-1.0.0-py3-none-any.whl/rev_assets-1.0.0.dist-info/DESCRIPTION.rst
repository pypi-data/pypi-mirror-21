RevAssets
===========================

Makes possible for python web apps to work with hashed static assets
generated by other tools like Gulp or Webpack.

It does so by reading the manifest generated by the revision tool.

        )

    Map the source -> hashed assets

    :param base_url: From where the hashed assets are served.
    :param reload: Reload the manifest each time an asset is requested.
    :param manifest: Path and filename of the manifest file.
