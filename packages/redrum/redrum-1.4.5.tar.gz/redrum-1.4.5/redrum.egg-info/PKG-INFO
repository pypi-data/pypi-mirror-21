Description: Redrum - Reddit Wallpaper Downloader and Ranker
        ==============================================
        
        .. image:: screenshot.png
        
        Redrum is a Reddit wallpaper downloader which scores wallpapers and selects the best based on resolution, aspect ratio, and number of views.  It remembers which wallpapers were selected previously so you never see the same image twice.
        
        Install the systemd units to run the script every two hours.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        1. Install through pip
        
           .. code:: bash
        
              pip3 install redrum
          
        2. Install systemd user unit (optional)
        
           * edit `systemd/redrum.service` to point to `redrum.py`
        
           * copy unit files
        
           .. code:: bash
        
              # copy service files
              cp -u systemd/* ~/.config/systemd/user/
        
              # enable and start systemd timer
              systemctl --user enable redrum.timer
              systemctl --user start redrum.timer
        
              # the service can be triggered manually as well
              systemctl --user start redrum
          
        Usage
        -----
        
        If redrum can't find a config file, it will create one in `~/.config/redrum.ini` automatically.  You should update this file with your screen resolution and preferred subreddits, then run redrum again.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           >>> redrum
           No config found at /home/evan/.config/redrum.ini.  Creating...
           Update config with your preferred options and run redrum again.
