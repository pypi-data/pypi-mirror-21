        unf contains Python code for Universal Numeric Fingerprints (UNFs)
        
        http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/developers/unf/index.html
        
        Version 0.5.0 contains two important design decisions:
        
        First, lists and tuples containing anything but primitives are not
        allowed.  The UNF specification does not handle this case, presumably
        since it was written with R in mind and nested vectors are not
        allowed in R.  Versions of this package before 0.5.0 normalized
        subsequences in place, but because normalized values are simply
        concatenated in sequences, the normalization of (1, (2, 3)) would
        then be the same as the normalization of (1, 2, 3) and the two would
        have the same UNF.
        
        Second, numpy arrays of greater than one dimension are handled the
        same way that R data frames and matrices are handled, but without
        the sorting step.  The UNFs for the components of an array are
        calculated, the results are put in a list, and the UNF of the
        resulting list is calculated.  numpy arrays with one dimension are
        treated as simple sequences.
