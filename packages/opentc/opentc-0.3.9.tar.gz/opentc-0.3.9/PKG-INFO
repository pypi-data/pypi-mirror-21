Description: Open Text Classification (OpenTC)
        =================================
        
        OpenTC is a text classification engine using machine learning. It is
        designed as client-server architecture and uses python libraries
        scikit-learn and tensorflow for it's machine learning algorithms.
        Currently following algorithms are supported:
        
        -  Naive Bayes
        -  Support Vector Machine
        -  Convolutional Neural Network
        
        In the future it will also support FastText from Facebookresearch.
        
        The engine is running as a server listening on command and text to be
        classified. By default it listens on localhost port 3333, but it can be
        changed in the yaml configuration file.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        -  Python 3.x
        -  numpy
        -  pyparsing
        -  PyYAML
        -  scikit-learn
        -  scipy
        -  tensorflow 1.x

        synopsis

        Description
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The daemon listens for incoming connections on TCP socket and classify
        files or text string on demand. It reads the configuration from
        /etc/opentc/opentc.yml
        
        Commands
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        The command uses a newline character as the delimiter. If opentcd
        doesn't recognize the command, or the command doesn't follow the
        requirements specified below, it will reply with an error message, but
        still wait for the next commands (this behaviour can be changed in the
        future).
        
        PING
        ^^^^
        
        Check the server's state. It should reply with "PONG".
        
        VERSION
        ^^^^^^^
        
        Print the program version
        
        RELOAD
        ^^^^^^
        
        Reload the engine
        
        LIST\_CLASSIFIER
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        List the supported classifiers (at the moment there are three
        classifiers supported: Bayesian, Support Vector Machine and
        Convolutional Neural Network). It shows also the status of classifier,
        either True (enabled) or False (disabled).
        
        SET\_CLASSIFIER
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Enabled or disabled the specific classifier
        
        PREDICT\_STREAM
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Classify text streams. It uses a new line character as delimiter for
        every sentences.
        
        PREDICT\_FILE
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Classify file. It uses a new line character as delimiter for every
        sentences
        
        CLOSE
        ^^^^^
        
        Close the connection
