Description: Sorting Algorithms
        ==================
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        This project includes a various number or sorting algorithms written in
        Python. It was tested with Python 3.4, but should also work with other
        Python versions.
        
        The repository, where all the commits will be pushed, is on
        `Bitbucket`_. On `GitHub`_ appear only the already tested releases. So
        if you want to keep up-to-date you should have a look at `Bitbucket`_
        once in a while. If you just want to see the tested releases available
        on `PyPI`_ you have to have a look at `GitHub`_.
        
        version 1.0.0
        
        Algorithms
        ----------
        
        -  Bubble-Sort (slow)
        -  Ripple-Sort (slow)
        -  Min-Sort (better than previous ones)
        -  Quick-Sort (very fast and efficient)
        
        Additional
        ----------
        
        -  sorting of non-nested tuples (very fast)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The current version is available via ``pip``
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install sort-algorithms
        
        Upgrade
        -------
        
        You also can upgrade on the latest version with additional algorithms
        and features with:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install sort-algorithms --upgrade
