Sorting Algorithms
==================

|Build Status|

Description
-----------

This project includes a various number or sorting algorithms written in
Python. It was tested with Python >= 3.4.

The repository, where all the commits will be pushed, is on
`Bitbucket`_. On `GitHub`_ appear only the already tested releases. So
if you want to keep up-to-date you should have a look at `Bitbucket`_
once in a while. If you just want to see the tested releases available
on `PyPI`_ you have to have a look at `GitHub`_.

version 1.0.2

Algorithms
----------

-  Bubble-Sort (slow)
-  Ripple-Sort (slow)
-  Min-Sort (better than previous ones)
-  Quick-Sort (very fast and efficient)

Additional
----------

-  sorting of non-nested tuples (very fast)

Installation
------------

The current version is available via ``pip``

.. code:: bash

    pip install sort-algorithms

Upgrade
-------

You also can upgrade on the latest version with additional algorithms
and features with:

.. code:: bash

    pip install sort-algorithms --upgrade
