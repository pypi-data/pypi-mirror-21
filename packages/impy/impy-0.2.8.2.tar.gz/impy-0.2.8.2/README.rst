IMP
###

The Integrated Meta-omic Pipeline (IMP) is developed to perform large-scale, reproducible and automated integrative reference free analysis of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data. IMP also performs single omic (i.e. metagenomic-only and metatrancriptomic-only) analysis as an additional functionality.
