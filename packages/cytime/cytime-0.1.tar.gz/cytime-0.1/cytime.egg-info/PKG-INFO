Description: # cytime
        
        Cdef equivalents of functions from Python's time module.
        
        This allows one to call time-related functions from Cython retaining
        the platform-independence one is used to from Python.
        
        As the C-level functions are not exposed, this is simply a re-distribution
        of the required portions of timemodule.c.
