Veripeditus - The Free AR Game Framework for Everyone
=====================================================

What is Veripeditus?
--------------------

Veripeditus (from Latin „veritas“ → „truth“ and „pedis“ → „foot“) is a
client/server augmented reality gaming engine and framework. It allows
writing game „cartridges“ for the server, which it can then run. Players
access the game while being outside with a mobile device.

Development
-----------

The server component, the framework and the games are developed in pure
Python. There are a few design/development principles:

-  Game cartridges must be easy to develop with basic Python skills
-  The framework and engine must be dynamic enough to allow a large
   number of different game types to be developed
-  The framework must not carry any code that is specific to only a
   single type of game
-  Development is test-driven and test-first
-  pylint is to be used and obeyed
-  Code must at all times be compatible with Python versions in Debian
   stable and Debian unstable

Features of the web frontend
----------------------------

The web frontend was originally intended to provide a quick view into
the game state on a Veripeditus server. It has, however, developed to
become a full-featured client for playing.

Depending on how cool HTML5 turns out to be, it might become the
official client and thus the first real-world HTML5 location based
real-time game.

Browser compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Veripeditus web frontend is developed and tested exactly on Mozilla
Firefox as there are no other free browsers that support HTML5 in a
reasonable way and can be entrusted with privacy critical data like
geolocation of a user.

Mozilla Firefox is available in any serious Linux distribution, as well
as for Android from the free `F-Droid <https://f-droid.org>`__ app
store. Rumour has it that there is also a version for iOS.

Testing system
--------------

A testing system is available at http://nightly.veripeditus.org/ . This
machine runs the current development version of Veripeditus and is
auto-deployed from Git.

It is unstable and might be broken. It will also lose data regularly.
