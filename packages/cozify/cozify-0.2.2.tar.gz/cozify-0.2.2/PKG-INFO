Description: # python-cozify
        Unofficial Python3 API bindings for the (unpublished) Cozify API. Includes 1:1 API calls plus helper functions to string together an authentication flow.
        
        ## Installation
        The recommended way is to install from PyPi:
        ```bash
           sudo -H pip3 install cozify
        ```
        or clone this repo (master branch may contain unstable features!) and:
        ```bash
           sudo python3 setup.py install
        ```
        
        
        ## Basic usage
        ### read devices, extract multisensor data
        ```python
        from cozify import hub, multisensor
        devices = hub.getDevices()
        print(multisensor.getMultisensorData(devices))
        ```
        ### only authenticate
        ```python
        from cozify import cloud
        cloud.authenticate()
        # authenticate() is interactive and usually triggered automatically
        # authentication data is stored in ~/.config/python-cozify.cfg
        ```
        ### authenticate with a non-default state storage
        ```python
        from cozify import cloud, config
        config.setStatePath('/tmp/testing-state.cfg')
        cloud.authenticate()
        # authentication and other useful data is now stored in the defined location instead of ~/.config/python-cozify.cfg
        ```
        
        ## Current limitations
        * Right now tokens are assumed to never expire and their functionality is not questioned.
        * For now there are only read calls. New API call requests are welcome as issues or pull requests!
        * authentication flow is as automatic as possible but still a bit fragile. Any reported issues are very welcome.
