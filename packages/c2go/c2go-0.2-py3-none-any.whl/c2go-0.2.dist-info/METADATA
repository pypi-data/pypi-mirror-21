C2Go 0.2
========

C2Go is based on the c-to-c.py example from pycparser by Eli Bendersky,
and uses pycparser extensively.

The C examples are from:
http://www.cis.temple.edu/~ingargio/cis71/code/.

Requirements
------------

-  python 2 or python 3
-  pycparser
-  ply

Installation
------------

``c2go.py`` can be installed as ie. ``/usr/bin/c2go``.

Usage
-----

The utility takes a filename as the first argument.

The parts of the C code that C2GO is unable to translate will be marked
with a ``/* C2GO: ? */`` comment in the resulting output.
