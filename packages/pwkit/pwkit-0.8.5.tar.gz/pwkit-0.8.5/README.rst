pwkit: miscellaneous Python for science and astronomy
*****************************************************

This is a collection of Peter Williams’ miscellaneous Python tools. I’m
packaging them so that other people can install them off of PyPI and run my
code without having to go to too much work. That’s the hope, at least.

The online documentation contains `installation instructions`_. The
documentation is very much a work in progress but `may be found here`_.
