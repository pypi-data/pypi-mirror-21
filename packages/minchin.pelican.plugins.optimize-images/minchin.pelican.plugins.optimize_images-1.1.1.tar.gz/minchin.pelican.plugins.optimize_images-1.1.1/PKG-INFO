Description: ===============
        Optimize Images
        ===============
        
        ``Optimize Images`` is a plugin for
        `Pelican <http://docs.getpelican.com/>`_, a static site generator written
        in Python.
        
        ``Optimize Images``  applies lossless compression on JPEG and PNG images,
        with no effect on image quality. It uses jpegtran_ and OptiPNG_.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The easiest way to install ``Optimize Images`` is through the use of pip.
        This will also install the required Python dependencies automatically
        (currently none beyond Pelican itself).
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
          pip install minchin.pelican.plugins.optimize_images
        
        It is assumed both jpegtran_ and OptiPNG_ are installed on system path.
        
        Then, in your ``pelicanconf.py`` file, add ``Optimize Images`` to your list
        of plugins:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
          PLUGINS = [
                      # ...
                      'minchin.pelican.plugins.optimize_images',
                      # ...
                    ]
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        ``Optimize Images`` depends on (and is really only useful with) Pelican.
        This can be manually installed with pip:
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
           pip install pelican
        
        It is assumed both jpegtran_ and OptiPNG_ are installed on system path. On
        Windows, installers are available at each respective website. On Ubuntu
        systems (including Travis-CI), the two can be installed via ``apt-get``:
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
          apt-get install optipng libjpeg-progs
        
        
        Configuration and Usage
        =======================
        
        The plugin will activate and optimize images upon ``finalized`` signal of
        pelican.
        
        The plugin has no user settings.
        
        
        Known Issues
        ============
        
        Image manipulation like this can take some time to run. You may consider
        only adding this plugin to your ``publishconf.py`` (rather than your base
        ``pelicanconf.py``), which will then only run this image optimization in
        preparation for site publication.
        
        An issue, as such, is that there is no formal test suite. Testing is
        currently limited to my in-use observations. I also run a basic check upon
        uploaded the package to PyPI that it can be downloaded and loaded into
        Python.
        
        The package is tested in Python 3.6; compatibility with other version of
        Python is unknown, but there should be nothing particular keeping it from working with other "modern" versions of Python.
