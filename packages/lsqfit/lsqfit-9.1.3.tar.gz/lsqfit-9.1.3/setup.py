    This package facilitates least-squares fitting of noisy data by
    multi-dimensional, nonlinear functions of arbitrarily many
    parameters. :mod:`lsqfit` provides the fitting capability;
    it makes heavy use of package :mod:`gvar`, which provides tools for
    the analysis of error propagation, and also for the creation of
    complicated multi-dimensional gaussian distributions. (:mod:`gvar`
    is distributed separately.) :mod:`lsqfit` supports Bayesian priors
    for the fit parameters, with arbitrarily complicated multidimensional
    Gaussian distributions. It uses automatic differentiation to compute
    gradients, greatly simplifying the design of fit functions.

    In addition to :mod:`gvar`, this package uses the Gnu Scientific
    Library (GSL) to do the fitting, numpy for efficient array arithmetic,
    and cython to compile efficient core routines and interface code.
