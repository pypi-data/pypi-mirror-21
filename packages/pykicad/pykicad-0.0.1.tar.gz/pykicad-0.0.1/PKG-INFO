Description: # Routines for generating and parsing KiCAD files
        
        There are multiple python scripts that read and write kicad file
        formats. Currently there is the problem that each project reimplements
        basic parsing and serialization of these formats.
        
        The aim of this project is to provide high quality and well tested
        format support so that other projects can focus on the interesting
        stuff.
        
        
        ## Supported file formats
        
        * Modules (*.pretty, *.kicad_mod) in module.py
        
        ## Formats that are on the TODO list
        
        * Netlists (*.net)
        * Pcbnew (*.kicad_pcb)
        * Schematic symbols (*.lib)
