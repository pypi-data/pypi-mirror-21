.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
KIWI is an imaging solution that is based on an image XML description.
Such a description is represented by a directory which includes at least
one \fBconfig.xml\fP or \fB\&.kiwi\fP file and may as well include other files like
scripts or configuration data.
.sp
A collection of example image descriptions can be found on the github
repository here: \fI\%https://github.com/SUSE/kiwi\-descriptions\fP\&. Most of the
descriptions provide a so called JeOS image. JeOS means Just enough
Operating System. A JeOS is a small, text only based image including a
predefined remote source setup to allow installation of missing
software components at a later point in time.
.sp
KIWI operates in two steps. The system build command combines
both steps into one to make it easier to start with KIWI. The first
step is the preparation step and if that step was successful, a
creation step follows which is able to create different image output
types.
.sp
In the preparation step, you prepare a directory including the contents
of your new filesystem based on one or more software package source(s)
The creation step is based on the result of the preparation step and
uses the contents of the new image root tree to create the output
image.
.sp
KIWI supports the creation of the following image types:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
ISO Live Systems
.IP \(bu 2
Virtual Disk for e.g cloud frameworks
.IP \(bu 2
OEM Expandable Disk for system deployment from ISO or the network
.IP \(bu 2
File system images for deployment in a pxe boot environment
.UNINDENT
.sp
Depending on the image type a variety of different disk formats and
architectures are supported.
.SH GLOBAL OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-\-color\-output
Use Escape Sequences to print different types of information
in colored output. The underlaying terminal has to understand
those escape characters. Error messages appear red, warning
messages yellow and debugging information will be printed light
grey.

Specify log file. the logfile contains detailed information about
the process.

XML description. The option can be specified multiple times to
allow using a combination of profiles
.TP
.BI \-\-shared\-cache\-dir\fB= <directory>

is shared via bind mount between the build host and image
root system and contains information about package repositories
and their cache and meta data. The default location is set
to /var/cache/kiwi

.SS DESCRIPTION
.sp
For disk based images, allow to resize the image to a new disk geometry.
The additional space is free and not in use by the image. In order to
make use of the additional free space a repartition process is required
like it is provided by kiwi\(aqs oem boot code. Therefore the resize operation
is useful for oem image builds most of the time.
.SS OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-root\fB= <directory>
The path to the root directory, if not specified kiwi
searches the root directory in build/image\-root below
the specified target directory
.TP
.BI \-\-size\fB= <size>
New size of the image. The value is either a size in bytes
or can be specified with m=MB or g=GB. Example: 20g

.SS DESCRIPTION
.sp
Provides information about the specified image description.
If no specific info option is provided the command just
lists basic information about the image which could also be
directly obtained by reading the image XML description file.
Specifying an extension option like \fBresolve\-package\-list\fP
will cause a dependency resolver to run over the list of
packages and thus provides more detailed information about
the image description.
.SS OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-add\-repo\fB= <source,type,alias,priority>
Add repository with given source, type, alias and priority.
.TP
.BI \-\-description\fB= <directory>
The description must be a directory containing a kiwi XML
description and optional metadata files.
.TP
.B \-\-ignore\-repos
Ignore all repos from the XML configuration.
.TP
.B \-\-obs\-repo\-internal
When using obs repos resolve them using the SUSE internal
buildservice. This only works if access to SUSE\(aqs internal
buildservice is granted.

.SS DESCRIPTION
.sp
build an image in one step. The build command combines kiwi\(aqs prepare and
create steps in order to build an image with just one command call. The
build command creates the root directory of the image below
\fB<target\-dir>/build/image\-root\fP and if not specified differently writes
a log file \fB<target\-dir>/build/image\-root.log\fP\&. The result image files
are created in the specified target\-dir.

.B \-\-obs\-repo\-internal
The repository source type \fBobs://\fP by default points to the
\fI\%Open Build Service\fP\&. With the
\fI\-\-obs\-repo\-internal\fP option the source type is changed to the
\fBibs://\fP type, pointing to the \fBInternal Build Service\fP\&.
This allows to build images with repositories pointing to the SUSE
internal build service. Please note this requires access permissions
to the SUSE internal build service on the machine building the image.

supported by the selected package manager. See the URI_TYPES section for

.IP \(bu 2
\fBalias\fP

an alias name as result from a sha sum. The sha sum is used to uniquely
identify the repository, but not very expressive. We recommend to
set an expressive and uniq alias name.
