Description: PARANOiA, named after the series of DDR songs, is a library for data structures
        and general manipulation of binary and executable data. It is capable of creating dynamic structures
        that can be resized based on elements given and comes with a more flexible interface for creating
        structures than c-types (hopefully!).
