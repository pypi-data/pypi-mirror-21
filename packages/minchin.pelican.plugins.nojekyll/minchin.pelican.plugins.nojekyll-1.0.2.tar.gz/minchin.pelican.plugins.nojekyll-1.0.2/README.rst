NoJekyll
========

``NoJekyll`` is a plugin for `Pelican <http://docs.getpelican.com/>`_,
a static site generator written in Python.

``NoJekyll`` creates a *.nojekyll* file in the root of your output directory.
This is useful when you are publishing your site to
`GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_ as it keeps your site from being
run through GitHub's defualt Jekyll site generator. This has a side effect
of make your updated site go live faster.
