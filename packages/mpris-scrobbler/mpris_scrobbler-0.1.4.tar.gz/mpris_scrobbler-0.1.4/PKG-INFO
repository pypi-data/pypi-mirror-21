Description: # mpris-scrobbler
        
        Scrobbler that can use any MPRIS-enabled media players.
        
        Currently only supports [wilt.fm][1]
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        This requires Python 3. I have only tested it on Python 3.6, so far.
        
        * This will **NOT** work in Windows.
        * Saves your credentials in plain text :(
        * Requires [dbus-python][2]
        
        ## Installation
        
        * `pip install mpris_scrobbler`
        
        or
        
        * `git clone https://git.mashek.net/bottitytto/mpris-scrobbler.git`
        
        
        ## Usage
        If you installed `mpris-scrobbler` via git, you will need to be in the project folder and prefix these commands with `python -m`:
        
        
        * `mpris_scrobbler` will prompt for everything
        * `mpris_scrobbler -u bottitytto -d vlc` will use these settings
        
        ```
        usage: mpris-scrobbler.py [-h] [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD] [-s SERVICE]
                                  [-d DEVICE]
        
        Scrobble from MPRIS-enabled devices
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                                Scrobble service username
          -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                                Scrobble service password
          -s SERVICE, --service SERVICE
                                Scrobble service. Options: wiltfm (default)
          -d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                                MPRIS device to scrobble from
        ```

        ## Notes
        
        Some players, like [Sayonara][5], must start playing a song before they will work with `mpris-scrobbler.`
