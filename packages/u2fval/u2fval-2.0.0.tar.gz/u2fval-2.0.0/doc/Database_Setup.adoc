== Database Setup
The Yubico U2F Validation Server requires an SQL database for storing data.
Internally, u2fval uses http://www.sqlalchemy.org[SQLAlchemy] to connect to
the database. Depending on which SQL database you use you might need to install
an adapter for it. For a list of supported databases, and the required adapters,
see http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html[SQLAlchemy Engine Configuration].

This document assumes you are using Ubuntu with the http://www.postgresql.org[Postgresql]
database. Start by installing Postgresql:

  # apt-get install postgresql

You will also need to install the required database adapter (assuming you're
using a virtualenv):

  $ source venv/bin/activate
  (venv) $ pip install psycopg2

To create a user and a database for u2fval, start by opening the psql prompt:

  # su postgres -c psql

Now create a user and a database:

  postgres=# create user u2fval with password 'password';
  postgres=# create database u2fval with owner u2fval;
  postgres=# \q

We're done. We now have a database named "u2fval", with a user named "u2fval",
and the password "password". This gives us the following connection string:

  postgresql://u2fval:password@localhost/u2fval

Edit the SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI setting in the
`/etc/yubico/u2fval/u2fval.conf` file with the connection string, so it reads:

  SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://u2fval:password@localhost/u2fval'

NOTE: There are many other settings related to the database that you can set in
this file. For a reference, see the
link:http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.1/config/[Flask-SQLAlchemy
configuration] documentation.

Save and close the file, and initialize the database for use with u2fval:

  (venv) $ u2fval db init

You can optionally specify a different configuration file to use, by setting
the U2FVAL_SETTINGS environment variable.

That's it, the database is now configured and ready.
