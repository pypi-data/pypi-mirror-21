== Installation
The recommended way to install the Yubico U2F Validation Server is by using pip
in a virtual environment (virtualenv). This document will guide you through
the setup and configuration of the server. It assumes you are familliar with
using virtualenv in Python.

=== Build dependencies
To build the project and its dependencies, you first need to install some build
dependencies. On Debian or Ubuntu this can be done by running:

  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev python-virtualenv

=== Create a virtual environment
To begin, create a new virtual environment and install u2fval:

  $ virtualenv venv
  $ source venv/bin/activate
  (venv) $ pip install -U pip
  (venv) $ pip install u2fval

=== Configuration
By default, u2fval will use the file `/etc/yubico/u2fval/u2fval.conf` for
configuration. This can be overridden by setting the U2FVAL_SETTINGS
environment variable to point to an alternative location. For an example of
this file, you can look at the `conf/u2fval.conf` file in the source release
tar.gz.

To use custom U2F device metadata, you can place metadata json files in
`/etc/yubico/u2fval/metadata/` or whatever location you specify in the
configuration file. By default, the bundled metadata from python-u2flib-server
is used.

To configure logging, see link:Logging.adoc[Logging].

=== Next steps
Before you can use the server you need to configure and initialize a database.
See link:Database_Setup.adoc[Database Setup] for an example on how to do that.

Once the database is set up, you will need to create at least one client, and
deploy the server in some way. See
link:Apache_Deployment.adoc[Apache Deployment] for an example on how to do
that.
