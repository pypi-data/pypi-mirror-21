== Logging
By default u2fval uses the built-in logging in Flask. This is handy for
development purposes, but may not be sufficient for production use. We
recommend deploying u2fval in a WSGI container when used in production and
configuring logging in a `.wsgi` file. Here is an example of such a file:

[source,python]
----
from u2fval import app
import logging
from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler

# First we remove the default logging handlers.
for handler in app.logger.handlers:
    app.logger.removeHandler(handler)

# Now we add our own.
handler = RotatingFileHandler('/var/log/u2fval.log', maxBytes=100000, backupCount=1)
handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
formatter = logging.Formatter('[%(levelname)s] %(asctime)s %(name)s: %(message)s', '%Y-%m-%d %I:%M:%S')
handler.setFormatter(formatter)
app.logger.addHandler(handler)

application = app
----

NOTE: You need to ensure that the server has permissions to write to the log
file, if using one of the Handlers that write to a file. For more information
on logging see
link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html[the Python logging module].
