.TH LOGDISSECT 1
.SH NAME
logdissect - Parse and merge log entries, and filter by date and other criteria.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlogdissect\fR [\fB-hsv\fR] [\fB--version\fR] [\fB--list-parsers\fR] [\fB--list-morphers\fR] [\fB--list-outputs\fR] [\fB-p \fI<parser>\fR] [\fB--last=\fI<period>\fR] [\fB--range=\fI<YYYYMMDDhhmm-YYYYMMDDhhmm>\fR] [\fB--grep=\fI<pattern>\fR] [\fB--rgrep=\fI<rpattern>\fR] [\fB--outlog=\fI<outlog>\fR] [\fB--label=\fI<fname|ftype>\fR] \fI<logfile>\fR [\fI<logfile2>\fR] [\fI<logfile3>\fR] ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlogdissect\fP is a tool for gaining insight into syslog files. It can merge multiple log files together together and sort by timestamp, and filter the results by time range and other criteria. Results are output to the terminal by default, and can also be output to standard syslog format, or to a JSON array. Files that end in .gz or .bz2 are ignored.

.SH OPTIONS

    \fB-h\fP, \fB--help\fR         show this help message and exit
    \fB--list-parsers\fR     returns a list of available parsers
    \fB--list-morphers\fR    returns a list of available morphers
    \fB--list-outputs\fR     returns a list of available output formats
    \fB-p \fIPARSER\fR          specifies parser to use (default: syslog)
    \fB-s\fR                 silences terminal output
    \fB-v\fR                 sets verbose terminal output

  Morph options:
    \fB--grep\fP=\fIPATTERN\fR     specifies a pattern to match
    \fB--host\fP=\fIHOST\fR        specifies a source host to match
    \fB--last\fP=\fILAST\fR        specifies preceeding time period (5m/3h/2d/etc)
    \fB--process\fP=\fIPROCESS\fR  specifies a source process to match
    \fB--range\fP=\fIRANGE\fR      specifies the range <YYYYMMDDhhmm-YYYYMMDDhhmm>
    \fB--rgrep\fP=\fIRPATTERN\fR   specifies a pattern to filter out

  Output options:
    \fB--outlog\fP=\fIOUTLOG\fR    sets the output file for standard log output
    \fB--label\fP=\fILABEL\fR      sets label type for OUTLOG <fname|fpath>
    \fB--outjson\fP=\fIOUTJSON\fR  sets the output file for JSON output

.SH EXAMPLES
    logdissect --last=10m auth.log
    
    logdissect --last=2m *
    
    logdissect -v --range=20160202020202-20170227213200 --label=fpath messages debug apache2/error.log
    
    logdissect -s --outlog=myaccess.log --grep=192.168.1.56 --last=30d --label=fname /var/log/apache2/access.log /var/log/apache2/other_vhosts_access.log

.SH NOTES
1. metadata: logdissect uses file modification times to assign years to syslog date stamps. This allows it to parse logs that span more than one year without a problem. If you are copying log files, always use 'cp -p' (or 'cp --preserve=timestamps') and 'scp -p' to preserve original mtimes and other file metadata.

2. Re-parsing: If you are planning on parsing an output file back into logdissect at some point, using JSON is highly recommended. The JSON output module uses date stamps that include a year. Re-parsing a standard log output file will cause problems if the file has a different mtime than the original logs.

3. --range shortcuts: The range module will fill in your ranges with zeroes if they are shorter than 14 characters. If you want to get a range of 20170204120000 to 20170204130000, you can save time and use 2017020412 and 2017020413.

4. --last options: the last option should be a number followed by either 's' for seconds, 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours, or 'd' for days (e.g. --last=20m).

5. Zipped files: Files that end in .gz, .bz2, or .zip are ignored.
