        1.2.0 (2017-04-17)
        ------------------
        
        - Added ``MANIFEST.in``.
        
        - Using Python's ``doctest`` module instead of depreacted
          ``zope.testing.doctest``.
        
        
        1.1 (2009-02-26)
        ----------------
        
        - Move the ``exclude`` directive into the original ``zope.configuration``
          package.
        
          So, this package is currently contains only a backward-compatibility
          import for ``exclude`` directive and is not useful anymore. However
          it's intended to contain miscellaneous extensions to the configuration
          framework and may contain more in future, so we are not marking is
          as deprecated for now.
        
        
        1.0 (2007-09-29)
        ----------------
        
        Initial release.

        Configuration Extensions for Filtering or Inhibiting Configuration
        ==================================================================
        
        The zc.configuration package used to provide the ``exclude`` directive
        for inhibiting configuration. It was included in the zope.configuration
        and this package currently provides a backward-compatibility imports
        and tests that ensure that it will work for people who are already
        using zc.configuration and not the newer zope.configuration.
        
        This package may contain more configuration extensions in future, but
        currently, it's not useful anymore as the only feature it provided,
        the ``exclude`` directive was merged into the original
        ``zope.configuration`` package.
        
        First, let's look at an example.  The zc.configuration.demo package
        has a ZCML configuration that includes some other configuration files.
        
        We'll set a log handler so we can see what's going on:
        
            >>> import logging, sys
            >>> logger = logging.getLogger('config')
            >>> oldlevel = logger.level
            >>> logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
            >>> handler = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
            >>> logger.addHandler(handler)
         
        Now, we'll include the zc.configuration.demo config:
        
            >>> from zope.configuration import xmlconfig
            >>> _ = xmlconfig.string('<include package="zc.configuration.demo" />')
            include /zc.configuration/src/zc/configuration/demo/configure.zcml
            include /zc.configuration/src/zc/configuration/demo/sub/configure.zcml
            include /zc.configuration/src/zc/configuration/demo/spam.zcml
        
        Each run of the configuration machinery runs with fresh state, so
        rerunning gives the same thing:
        
            >>> _ = xmlconfig.string('<include package="zc.configuration.demo" />')
            include /zc.configuration/src/zc/configuration/demo/configure.zcml
            include /zc.configuration/src/zc/configuration/demo/sub/configure.zcml
            include /zc.configuration/src/zc/configuration/demo/spam.zcml
        
        Now, we'll load the zc.configuration meta.zcml and use the exclude
        directive to exclude the two files included by the configuration file
        in zc.configuration.demo:
        
            >>> _ = xmlconfig.string(
            ... '''
            ... <configure  xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope">
            ...   <include package="zc.configuration" file="meta.zcml" />
            ...   <exclude package="zc.configuration.demo.sub" />
            ...   <exclude package="zc.configuration.demo" file="spam.zcml" />
            ...   <include package="zc.configuration.demo" />
            ... </configure>
            ... ''')
            include /zc.configuration/src/zc/configuration/meta.zcml
            include /zc.configuration/src/zc/configuration/demo/configure.zcml
            
        
        .. cleanup
        
            >>> logger.setLevel(oldlevel)
            >>> logger.removeHandler(handler)
