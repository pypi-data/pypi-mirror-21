        Mac OSX installation
        --------------------
        
        For new OSX versions (El Capitan and above) the default system python
        installation cannot be modified with standard means. There are some
        workarounds, but one can also use ``--user`` switch for pip.
        
        ::
        
            pip install --user cryptography
        
        PIP update appdirs error
        ------------------------
        
        Pip may have a problem with updating appdirs due to missing directory. It helps to update this package manually
        
        ::
        
            pip install --upgrade --no-cache appdirs
        
        
        Database setup
        --------------
        
        State is stored in MySQL database.
        
        
        .. code:: sql
        
            CREATE DATABASE vpnauth CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
            GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON vpnauth.* TO 'vpnauth'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'vpnauth_passwd';
            FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
