aws utils fit for a chimp

Utilities:

  manage_creds:

    Allows you to refer to AWS profiles from both ~/.aws/credentials and
    ~/.aws/config files.

    Search order is:
      ~/.aws/credentials
      ~/.aws/config

    First match wins.

    For role profiles you can call get_temp_keys() and it will fetch temporary
    keys form STS and cache them in a dot file in your home directory.

    For more info on creating role profiles in ~/.aws/config:
