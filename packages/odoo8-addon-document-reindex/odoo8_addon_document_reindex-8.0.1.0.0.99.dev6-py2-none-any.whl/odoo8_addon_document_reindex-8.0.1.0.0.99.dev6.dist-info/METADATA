Reindex documents
=================

This module allows you to reindex documents in case they were uploaded when the right configuration for indexation was missing.

Usage
=====

To reindex a single document, open its form and click the `Reindex document` button.

To reindex all documents, go to Settings / Configuration / Knowledge, check the box `Reindex all documents` or `Reindex all unindexed documents` and click apply. Those are done in the background, so watch your logs for the process to finish.

In a migration context, you might want to reindex all or unindexed documents. To achieve this, create a config parameter `document_reindex.reindex_unindexed_on_init` or `document_reindex.reindex_all_on_init` to have the reindexation run synchronously during installation of this module.
