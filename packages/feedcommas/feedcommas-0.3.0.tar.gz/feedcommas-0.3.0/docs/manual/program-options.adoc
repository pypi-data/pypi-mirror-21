== Program options

// tag::manpage[]

The following parameters can be passed to Feed Commas when it's started:

=== General options

*-c, --config*=_CONFIG_FILE_::
  Use a _CONFIG_FILE_ as Feed Commas' configuration file. This file is used
  instead of the one which would be normally found by a default configuration
  search. If _CONFIG_FILE_ doesn't exists, it is created.
+
Feed Commas reports if _CONFIG_FILE_ is incorrect somehow or if it couldn't be
created and quits in that case.

=== Program information

*--help*::
  Prints a short summary of available program options and quits.

*--version*::
  Prints a version of Feed Commas and quits.

// end::manpage[]
