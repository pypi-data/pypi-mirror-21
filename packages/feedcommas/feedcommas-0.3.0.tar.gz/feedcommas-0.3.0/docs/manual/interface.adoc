On the first run , Feed Commas will ask you to fill credentials needed to login
to CommaFeed. Above screen will be displayed. You can navigate it using
kbd:[Tab], kbd:[Shift+Tab], and arrow buttons: kbd:[↑], kbd:[↓], kbd:[←] and
kbd:[→].

You should enter either *plain text password* (which is discouraged) or
*password command*, which should be a shell command returning a single line
containing a password used to log in to your CommaFeed account.

To confirm credentials, either click `< Ok >` button or press kbd:[Enter]. To
exit Feed Commas, click `< Cancel >` button or press kbd:[Esc].

Correct credentials are saved to your configuration file (see <<config>> and
<<cfg-server,server>> sections for details about that) and you are then
presented Feed Commas main window.

[TIP]
.A note about passwords
====
Plain text password is saved into `password` field in your configuration.
Password command is  saved into `password-cmd` field in your configuration and
takes precedence over `password` if they're both set.

If your password command returns several lines of text, you can use standard
Unix tools to filter it, because `password-cmd` is called by a spawned child
shell. For example:

----
pass commafeed | head -1
----

Some commands return passwords terminated with a newline character: `\n`. Feed
Commas doesn't strip it by itself and you might be unable to log into CommaFeed
with it. You can easily remove newline by piping your command's output to `tr`,
which is another standard Unix tool available on all POSIX-compatible operating
systems:

----
pass commafeed | head -1 | tr -d '\n'

 ▲ Commandline / message display
----

Above is example view of Feed Commas, drawn to fit 80-characters-wide terminal.
Interface resizes dynamically, so on modern displays you'll encounter more free
space.

Two main parts are: 1) menu with subscribed feeds and categories on the left,
and 2) article list on the right.

Feed Commas starts with a focus on article list. To switch between menu and
article list, use kbd:[h] and kbd:[l]. kbd:[j] and kbd:[k] navigates menu and
scrolls article list. See <<navigation,navigation>> for details.

There's also a command line on the bottom of the screen. It's accessible by
pressing kbd:[:] key. To close it, press kbd:[Esc] or delete all of the typed
text. To show completion hints press kbd:[Tab].

Above a commandline there's a single line called <<status-line,status line>>. It
displays several informations (like whether Feed Commas is in online/offline
mode) and notifications and messages sent by Feed Commas to the user.

=== Commands

Most of the commands are bound to some key by default, but not all of them. All
of them, however, are available to be used via a commandline. All commands,
beside <<navigation,navigation>> ones (`nav-up`, `nav-down`, `nav-right` and
`nav-left`) are available. For a complete list, see <<cfg-keys,keys>>
subsection.

You don't have to type the whole command. If there's only one command which
starts with a typed substring, a correct command will be executed. No command is
executed in case of ambiguity. For example, `:q` will work the same as `:quit`,
but `:read` won't run anything because there are two possible commands:
`read-toggle` and `read-all`.
