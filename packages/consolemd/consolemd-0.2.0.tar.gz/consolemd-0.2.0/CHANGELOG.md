# Changelog

Here's what we all hope is an accurate list of things that have changed
between versions.

## v0.2.0

* inserting vertical whitespace is much simpler and much more effective
* added --soft-wrap option to break at source line endings

## v0.1.0

First release. Appears to work even if the styling code is pretty ugly.
