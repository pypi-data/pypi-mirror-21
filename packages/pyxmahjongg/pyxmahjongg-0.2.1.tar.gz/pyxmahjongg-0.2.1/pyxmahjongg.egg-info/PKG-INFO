Description: pyxmahjongg
        ===========
        
        python rewrite of the original xmahjongg-game from 1989:
        
        https://www.lcdf.org/xmahjongg/
        
        The python implementation does not need the X11 files anymore, however the name is still 'pyxmahjongg'.
        
        
        Run the program
        ---------------
        
            python pyxmahjongg.py -h
        
        Use the optional -h flag for help to change colors and layouts.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Requires 'pillow' for image-handling.
        
        'pyxmahjongg' is developed with Python 3.6 and and pillow 4.0.0 and not tested with earlier versions.
        
        
        Remarks
        -------
        
        This implementation uses the same layout-files as the original one but just the dorothys tileset. Excerpt from the original documentation:
        
        The default tileset was originally created in color by Dorothy Robinson <mokuren@teleport.com> with Mark A. Holm <markh@aracnet.com>. The publically available version was in black-and-white. Holm copyrighted the tiles in 1988, giving permission to copy and distribute for non-profit purposes. The significantly altered color version that comes with xmahjongg was created by Eddie Kohler in later years.
        
        
        License
        -------
        
        Because of the original license it is permitted to use the tileset for non-profit purposes. As a consequence any commercial uses of this program and the used tileset is prohibited. Furthermore the usage of this program is entirely at your own risk.
