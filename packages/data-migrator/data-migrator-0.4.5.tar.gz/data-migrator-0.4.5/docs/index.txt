Welcome to data-migrator'!
============================================

data-migrator is database transformation in a pipes and filter, declarative kind of way, Python/Django style.

Data transformation is an important process in software development when architectures upgrade and data has to move along. This requires fast and easy restructuring of data in a repetitive way. Quite quickly ad-hoc scripts or transfer data, upgrade it in sql second is not flexible enough. For those cases *data-migrator* is an answer.

Once you 've :doc:`installed <install>` *data-migrator*, we recommend reading the

  * :doc:`Introduction <intro>` first,
  * Take a look at the :doc:`Example <example>`
  * after that continue with the :doc:`Tutorial <tutorial/tutorial0>`
