Introduction
------------
This library is a high level python API wrapper upon ThoughtWorks GoCD REST API.
From the official documentation:

    Go Continuous Delivery is continuous integration/deployment server,
    which helps you automate and streamline the build-test-release cycle for worry-free.

Using it, you can access to internals of the Pipelines, check their statuses, download Artifacts and more.
It is designed with maximum comfort and productivity from the user perspective, so it should be very easy
to use it in your own project.
More information is available at official `documentation <http://yagocd.readthedocs.io>`_

Installation
------------
.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install yagocd

Quick example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    from yagocd import Yagocd

    go = Yagocd(
        server='https://example.com',
        auth=('user', 'password'),
        options={
            'verify': False  # skip verification for SSL certificates.
        }
    )

    for pipeline in go.pipelines:   # Iterate over all pipelines
        for instance in pipeline:   # Iterate over each instance of some pipeline
            for stage in instance:  # Iterate over each stages of some pipeline instance
                for job in stage:   # Iterate over each job of some pipeline
                    for root, folder, files in job.artifacts:  # Iterate over artifacts like `os.walk` manner
                        for artifact in files:
                            print(artifact.data.url)

                    # print property of each job
                    for key, value in job.properties.items():
                        print("{} => {}".format(key, value))
