*An interactive pip requirements upgrader. Because upgrading requirements, package by package, is a pain in the ass.
It also updates the version in your requirements.txt file.


Purpose
-------

This cli tools helps you interactively(or not) upgrade packages from requirements file,
and also **update the pinned version from requirements file(s)**.

If no requirements are given, the command **attempts to detect the requirements file(s)** in the current directory.

Quick preview:

Installation
------------

::

    pip install pip-upgrader

Usage
-----
**Activate your virtualenv** (important, because it will also install the new versions of upgraded packages in current virtualenv)

**CD into your project.**
Then:
::

    $ pip-upgrade

Arguments:
    requirements_file       The requirement FILE, or WILDCARD PATH to multiple files.
    --prerelease            Include prerelease versions for upgrade, when querying pypi repositories.
    -p <package>            Pre-choose which packages tp upgrade. Skips any prompt.


Examples:

::

    pip-upgrade             # auto discovers requirements file. Prompts for selecting upgrades
    pip-upgrade requirements.txt
    pip-upgrade requirements/dev.txt requirements/production.txt

    # skip prompt and manually choose some/all packages for upgrade
    pip-upgrade requirements.txt -p django -p celery
    pip-upgrade requirements.txt -p all

    # include pre-release versions
    pip-upgrade --prerelease


Final notes
-----------
If you encounter any bugs, please open an issue and it will be magically resolved :)

**TODO (nothing major):**

- implement support for :code:`package>=0.1.0` (only works for :code:`package==0.1.0`)
- tests / travis ci checks / coveralls


Have fun! :)

Contributing
------------
Clone the repository, create a virtualenv, then run:
::

    pip install -e .[test]
    py.test

This command will :

- run tests
- print coverage report
- print pep8 errors


Notes for me:
Release new version:
::

    $ rm -rf dist && python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    $ twine upload dist/* -u SimionBaws -p my_pass
