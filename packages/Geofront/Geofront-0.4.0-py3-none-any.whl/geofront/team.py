""":mod:`geofront.team` --- Team authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Geofront doesn't force you to manage team members by yourself.
Instead it hides how to manage team members, and offers :class:`Team`,
the layering interface to implement custom team data provider
e.g. :class:`~.backends.github.GitHubOrganization`.

It is theologically possible to implement a straightforward RDBMS-backed
team provider, but we rather recommend to adapt your existing team data
instead e.g. `GitHub organization`__, `Google Apps organization`__,
`Bitbucket team`__.

       identity authentication between team membership authorization.
