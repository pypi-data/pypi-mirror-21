The dot matches any character. Consider it like a character class with all
existing characters in it.

For this adventure, write a python function that receives a string and
returns `True` if it starts with 'python', followed by any character,
followed by 'python' again; and `False` otherwise.

You can use this template to get started:

.. sourcecode:: python

    import re

    def test(string):
        # Your code goes here

When you are done, you must run:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    $ {script} verify program.py
