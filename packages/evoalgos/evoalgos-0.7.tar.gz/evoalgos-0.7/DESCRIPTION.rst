Description
===========

This package contains the S-metric selection evolutionary multi-objective
optimization algorithm (SMS-EMOA) and the non-dominated sorting genetic
algorithm 2 (NSGA2) for multiobjective optimization. For single-objective
optimization, classical evolution strategies are provided. The algorithms can
work on real-valued and binary search spaces.

The package is geared to work with optimization problems as defined in the
package optproblems. The whole package assumes minimization problems
throughout!
