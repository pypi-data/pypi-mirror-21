Description: Makebib
        =======
        
        A simple script to generate a local bib file from a central database so
        that only items actually cited appear.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ makebib arg
        
        where ``arg`` is either
        
        -  the basename of a TeX-file, in which case the script creates a bib
           file and populates it with items which are cited by the document and
           can be found in the central database. Then it runs (a python version)
           of bibtex on the texfile.
        
        or
        
        -  ``--list`` which is followed by one of ``cited``, ``missing``,
           ``all``, ``cfg`` and (in the first three cases) a TeX-file in which
           case the program prints out a list of
        
        -  ``cited`` citekeys which are cited in the TeX-file
        
        -  ``missing`` citekeys which are cited in the TeX-file but not present
           in the central database
        
        -  ``all`` all citekeys in the central database
        
        -  ``cfg`` configuration
        
        or
        
        -  ``--help`` which prints out a short help message
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        The program reads its configuration from the files ``/etc/makebib``,
        ``~/.makebib`` or ``.makebib`` in the current directory. If either of
        the files does not exist, it is skipped. Also, options specified in
        later files override options specified in the previous files (and
        defaults). The files follow a simple
        
        ::
        
                key = val
        
        format with each line specifying a single case-insensitive option.
        Spaces around ``=`` are ignored as is everything following a ``#`` sign.
        Currently the only available option is ``db`` which specifies the
        location of the central BibTeX database.
