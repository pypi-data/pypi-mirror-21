### NENGORC FORMAT

# Nengo RC settings will be read from the following files.
# Files listed first have higher precendence.
#
# 1. nengorc in the current directory.
#    This is useful for settings specific to a single project.
# 2. A operating system specific file in the user's home directory.
#    This is useful for settings you want to apply to all Nengo projects.
#    - Windows: %userprofile%\nengo\nengorc
#    - Other (OS X, Linux): ~/.config/nengo/nengorc
# 3. INSTALL/nengo-data/nengorc (where INSTALL is the installation directory
#    of the Nengo package; this is usually something like
#    /usr/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages or C:\PythonXX\Lib\site-packages).
#
# This example file lists the settings supported by core Nengo with
# a description, the accepted data type and an example line setting the option
# to its default value (commented out).
#
# The RC file is divided into sections by lines containing the section name
# in square brackets. Blanks lines, or lines starting with # or, are ignored,
# as are trailing comments. A setting is set by giving the name followed by
# a : or = and the value.
#
# [example_section]
# setting: value  # optional comment

### CONFIGURATION BEGINS HERE

# Settings for the decoder cache
[decoder_cache]

# Enable or disable the cache. (boolean)
#enabled: True

# Set the cache to read-only. In read-only mode cached decoders will be
# loaded, but no newly calculated decoders will be written to the cache.
# (boolean)
#readonly: False

# Set the maximum cache size. Whenever the cache exceeds this limit, cached
# decoders will be deleted, beginning with the oldest, until the limit
# is met again. Please specify the unit (e.g., 512 MB). (string)
#size: 512 MB

# Path where the cached decoders will be stored. (string)
#path: ~/.cache/nengo/decoders  # Linux default


# Settings for the progress bar
[progress]

# Progress bar to use. Can be 'none' (disable the progress bar), 'auto'
# (automatically show the progress bar for long running simulations), or the
# name of some class implementing the nengo.utils.progress.ProgressBar
# interface (e.g., 'nengo.utils.progress.ProgressBar').
#progress_bar: auto

# Progress updating scheme. Can be 'auto' (automatically determine the updating
# scheme) or the name of some class implementing the
# nengo.utils.progress.ProgressUpdater interface (e.g.,
# 'nengo.utils.progress.UpdateEveryT').
#updater: auto


# Settings for error messages due to exceptions
[exceptions]

# Use simplified exceptions. In most cases, simplified exceptions will be
# easier to read and more useful for model development. However,
# developers of Nengo internals or tools extending Nengo
# may benefit from full exception tracebacks.
#simplified: True
