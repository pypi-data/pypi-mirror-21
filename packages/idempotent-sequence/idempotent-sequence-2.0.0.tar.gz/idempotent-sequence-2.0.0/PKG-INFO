Description: idempotent-sequence
        ===================
        
        A set of Python classes to declare an idempotent sequence of commands --
        a sequence that can be run repeatedly and on success will produce
        the same side effects no matter how many times you invoke it.
        
        This is useful when you have a sequence of commands each of which can
        fail and you want to keep rerunning the sequence until it succeeds, yet 
        you don't want to run previously completed parts again.
        
        You can install the package with `pip install idempotent-sequence`
        
        See example under `examples/example01.py`.
        
        To run the example: `python -m idemseq.examples.example01 --help`
