YNCA
====

Automation Library for Yamaha receivers that support the YNCA protocol.


Installation
============

pip3 install ynca


Usage
=====

This package contains:
 * YncaReceiver: a class that represents YNCA capable receiver and allows you to control it
 * ynca_console: a function that provides a console to directly give YNCA commands and see the responses (debugging)

Example
=======
# Create a receiver object. This call takes a while (multiple seconds) since
# it communicates quite a lot with the actual device.
# Note that later calls that control the receiver are are fast (they get async responses)
receiver = ynca.YncaReceiver("/dev/tty1")  # Port could also be e.g. COM3 on Windows or 192.168.1.12 for IP connection

# Attributes that are still None after initialization are not supported by the receiver/zone
#``receiver.zones`` is a dictionary with all available zone object for the receiver
main = receiver.zones["MAIN"]  # other possible zones are ZONE2, ZONE3 and ZONE4
print(main.name)  # Print the name of the main zone

#``receiver.inputs`` is a dictionary of available inputs with the key being the unique ID and the value the friendly name
if available
print(main.inputs)

# To get notifications when something changes register callbacks
def on_update_callback():
    pass
main.on_update_callback = on_update_callback

# Examples to control the zone
main.on = True
main.input = "HDMI3"
main.volume_up()
