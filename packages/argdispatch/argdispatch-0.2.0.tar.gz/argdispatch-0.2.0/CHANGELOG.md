* argdispatch 0.2.0 (2017-04-28)

    * Add python3.6 support.
    * Help message are no longer searched in `__main__` modules and in modules
      that are not packages. Closes #2.

        This adds a (minor) backward incompatibility, since some help messages
        are no longer searched in the same module they were searched before (or a
        no longer searched at all). However, this was necessary because it fixes
        a bad design. For instance, searching a help message in the docstring of
        a `__main__` package means importing it to access the docstring, and
        (maybe) importing it again to run it. This is discouraged, and displayed
        the warning (described in #2).
