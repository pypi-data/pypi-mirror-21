Description: # Spectroscopy
        
        Makes nonlinear spectroscopy of vibrational systems easy and object-oriented.
        
        The user need only define a system file and then feed its constituents into an experiment object and observables such as Absorption, Pump Probe and Transient Grating can easily be calculated.
        
        For details on the physics of what's going on here, see the introduction section of my forthcoming thesis which will be published at my github page: https://github.com/jgoodknight/
        
        For details on how to use the code, I think it will be much more instructive to look at the examples folder.
