PyMamba is a Python database library which utilises LMDB as a storage engine. It's name is derived from the
*Black Mamba*, the fastest snake on the planet. Typically PyMamba is a number of orders of magnitude
faster than alternatives such as MySQL or MongoDB, the trade-off is a reduced feature-set and a lack of language
portability.
