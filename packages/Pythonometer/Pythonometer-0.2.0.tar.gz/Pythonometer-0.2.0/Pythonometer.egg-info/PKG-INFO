Description: Pythonometer
        ============
        
        Pythonometer is tool for measuring how good someone is at Python.
        
        The goal of this project is to have a comprehensive set of code
        questions covering all areas of Python, so that a Pythonometer score
        will accurately represent how good someone is at python, and that anyone
        practicing for the sake of getting a good score will actually become
        very good at coding in Python.
