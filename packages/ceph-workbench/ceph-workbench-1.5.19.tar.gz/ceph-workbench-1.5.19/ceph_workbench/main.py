            it does not already exist). All open Backport issues are
            looked up in http://tracker.ceph.com using the REST API
            with the $redmine_key credentials. The status of the
            corresponding GitHub pull request is verified using
            $github_token to increase the API rate limit. The redmine
            issues that should be modified (i.e. their release field
            set and the status changed to Resolved) are displayed but
            nothing is done because of --dry-run.

            Instead of cloning the Ceph repository every time, an existing
            one can be used at $HOME/ceph. More often than not, the local
            branches of a local clone of the Ceph repository do not reflect
            the latest state of the main repository. With --git-remote ceph,
            a remote is used instead of the local branches:

            $ git remote -v | grep '^ceph'
            ceph	http://github.com/ceph/ceph (fetch)
            ceph	http://github.com/ceph/ceph (push)

            To ensure the remote is up to date, a git fetch ceph is done
            during initialization. Working with a local repository is
            necessary because GitHub does not provide a reliable way to
            get the SHA of a merged pull request (see
            f2aa9e5cc8138a7607a460dbea271e7d907a228a for more information).

            key to sign the packages. The corresponding public key is
            made available as release-key.asc in this directory.

            If a tag vX.Y.Z corresponding to the --version X.Y.Z
            option exists, that tag will be used to build the
            packages. Otherwise a new tag vX.Y.Z will be created,
            pointing to the tip of the branch. The read-only Ceph
            repository at http://IP/ceph/ is made available
