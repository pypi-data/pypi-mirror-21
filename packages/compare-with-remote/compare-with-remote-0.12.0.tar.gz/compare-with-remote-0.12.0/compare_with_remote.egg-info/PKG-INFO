        compare-with-remote
        ---------------------
        
        Compare local files with remote files 
        
        About
        -----
        
        This is a generic file comparing tool. I wrote it to help the transition from "pet to cattle". With other words
        I am switching from linux server managed with vi and ssh to configuration management.
        
        It helps you to compare files on a remote host with files on your local file system.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            pip install -e git+https://github.com/guettli/compare-with-remote.git#egg=compare-with-remote
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            ===> compare-with-remote -h
            usage: compare-with-remote [-h]
                                       [--only-files-containing-pattern ONLY_FILES_CONTAINING_PATTERN]
                                       directory_url_one directory_url_two
        
            compare two directories. Directories can get fetched via ssh first, then
            "meld" get called to copmare the directories. See https://github.com/guettli
            /compare-with-remote
        
            positional arguments:
              directory_url_one     [[user@]remote-host:]dir
              directory_url_two     [[user@]remote-host:]dir
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              --only-files-containing-pattern ONLY_FILES_CONTAINING_PATTERN
        
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        You want to compare all files in the /etc directory which contain the word "rsyslog":
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            root@local-server> compare-with-remote --only-files-containing-pattern rsyslog \
                                                      root@server-with-cute-name-1:/etc \
                                                      root@server-with-cute-name-2:/etc
        
        You can compare the output of scripts like this:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
            root@local-server> compare-with-remote \
                'postgres@server-with-cute-name-1:psql -c "select app, name from django_migrations order by id"' \
                'postgres@server-with-cute-name-2:'
        
        If you don't provide a remote-command for the second host, then the command from the first host will get called. In this case
        all rows of a database table get compared.
        
        
        Screenshots
        -----------
        
        After fetching the files, the script calls the tool "meld" to show the actual diff:

        Here is a screenshot of meld showing the difference between two files:
