Description: WASPy
        =====
        
        Waspy is the python framework for the `WASP
        project <https://github.com/wasp/wasp>`__. In other words its an
        asynchronous "transport-agnostic" web framework.
        
        Language agnostic concepts
        --------------------------
        
        While this framework is for python, the patterns used in wasp are
        language agnostic. You should be able to call other services in
        different languages assuming they all follow the same patterns. This
        framework has a pluggable architecture for the transport layer, which
        allows you to switch from http to using a message bus, or vice-versa.
        You could even listen on both at the same time without having to modify
        your code at all.

        transporty - [x]: Support middlewares - [x]: Client library (for calling
        other services) - [x]: HTTP client transport (with envvar service
        discovery) - [ ]: RabbitMQ client transport
        
        Wish List: - [ ]: Transport classes for nats (nats.io) - [ ]: Transport
        classes for kafka - [ ]: pattern for synchronous "worker-tier" - [ ]:
