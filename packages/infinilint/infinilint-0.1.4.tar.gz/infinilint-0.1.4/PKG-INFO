Description: Infinilint
        =======================
        
        Infinilint is a configurable lint runner. The base yaml configuration includes
        many common linters and a new linter is added with 3 or 4 lines of yaml. The
        linters are Docker images and are run in parallel to maximize feedback and make
        it practical to run continuously during development and as a stage in CI.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Infinilint depends on Docker. Install the latest version for your platform.
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        Clone this repo and run::
        
            pip install .
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To see the configured linters::
        
            infinilint --list
        
        To run a single linter::
        
            infinilint rubocop
        
        Run all enabled linters::
        
            infinilint
        
        Watch a folder continuously and run linters on any changes::
        
            infinilint --watch
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        In the root of your repository, create a .infinilint.yml file. This file will
        be combined with the base.yml in application folder. To enabled linters, create
        a file that looks like::
        
            linters:
                rubocop:
                    enabled: true
                yamllint:
                    enabled: true
        
        To add a linter not configured in the base.yml, create entries using the
        base.yml as a model.
        
        Additional root values you can set in your config::
        
            timeout: maximum number of seconds the tool is allowed to run
            proxy: address of a local docker registry to pull the images from instead of dockerhub
