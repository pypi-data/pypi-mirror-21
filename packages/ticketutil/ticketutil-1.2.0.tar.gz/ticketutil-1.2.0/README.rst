ticketutil is a Python module that allows you to easily interact with
various ticketing tools using their REST APIs. Currently, the supported
tools are JIRA, RT, Redmine, Bugzilla and ServiceNow.
Kerberos authentication is supported for JIRA and RT, while
HTTP Basic authentication is supported for Redmine, Bugzilla and ServiceNow.

This module allows you to create tickets, add comments, edit ticket
fields, and change the status of tickets in each tool. Additional
lower-level tool-specific functions are supported - adding and removing
watchers in JIRA, adding attachments in JIRA, etc.

Simplify all of your ticketing operations with ticketutil:

.. code-block:: python

    from ticketutil.jira import JiraTicket
    t = JiraTicket(<jira_url>, <project_key>, auth='kerberos')

    # Create a ticket and perform some common ticketing operations.
    t.create(summary='Ticket summary',
             description='Ticket description')
    t.add_comment('Test Comment')
    t.change_status('Done')

    # Close Requests session.
    t.close_requests_session()

Installation
------------

Install ticketutil with ``pip install ticketutil``.

ticketutil is compatible with Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6.
Note: For Python 2.6 and lower, an additional package, importlib, may
need to be installed.

If not installing with pip, a short list of packages defined in the
requirements.txt file need to be installed. To install the required
packages, type ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.

Usage
-----

The general usage workflow for creating new tickets is:

* Create a JiraTicket, RTTicket, RedmineTicket, BugzillaTicket
  or ServiceNowTicket object with ``<url>``, ``<project>`` and ``<auth>``. This
  verifies that you are able to properly authenticate to the ticketing tool.
  For tools that require HTTP Basic Authentication (Redmine, Bugzilla and
  ServiceNow), the ``<auth>`` parameter should contain the username and
  password specified as a tuple. For tools that support kerberos authentication
  (JIRA and RT), the ``<auth>`` parameter should contain 'kerberos'.
* Create a ticket with the ``create()`` method. This sets the ``ticket_id``
  instance variable, allowing you to perform more tasks on the ticket.
* Add comments, edit ticket fields, add watchers, change the ticket
  status, etc on the ticket.
* Close ticket Requests session with ``close_requests_session()``.

To work on existing tickets, you can also pass in a fourth parameter
when creating a Ticket object: ``<ticket_id>``. The general workflow for
working with existing tickets is as follows:

* Create a JiraTicket, RTTicket, RedmineTicket, BugzillaTicket
  or ServiceNowTicket object with ``<url>``, ``<project_key>``, ``<auth>`` and
  ``<ticket_id>``.
* Add comments, edit ticket fields, add watchers, change the ticket
  status, etc on the ticket.
* Close ticket Requests session with ``close_requests_session()``.

There is also a ``set_ticket_id()`` method for a Ticket object. This is
useful if you are working with a Ticket object that already has the
``<ticket_id>`` instance variable set, but would like to begin working
on a separate ticket. Instead of creating a new Ticket object, you can
simply pass an existing ``<ticket_id>`` in to the ``set_ticket_id()``
method to begin working on another ticket.

To return the current Ticket object's ticket_id or ticket_url, use the
``get_ticket_id()`` or ``get_ticket_url()`` methods.

To run unit tests in Bash terminal use this command:
``python3 -m unittest discover ./tests/``

See the docstrings in the code or the tool-specific files in the docs
and examples directories for more information.

Note on logging: To enable debug logging for ticketutil, set an environment
variable named TICKETUTIL_LOG_LEVEL to 'DEBUG'. You may specify the following
log levels using this environment variable: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR,
CRITICAL. If this environment variable does not exist, the log level will be
set to INFO by default.

Comments? / Questions? / Coming Soon
------------------------------------

For questions / comments, email dranck@redhat.com.
For anything specific to Bugzilla, email kshirsal@redhat.com.
For ServiceNow related questions, email pzubaty@redhat.com.

The plan for ticketutil is to support more ticketing tools in the near
future and to support more ticketing operations for the currently
supported tools. Please let us know if there are any suggestions /
requests.
Thanks!
