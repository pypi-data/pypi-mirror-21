CHANGES
=======

2.1 (2017-04-13)
----------------

- Officially support Python 3.6.

2.0 (2016-04-28)
----------------

- Made the package compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3 at the same time.

- Backwards-incompatible change towards stricter comparison behaviour: While
  arbitrary objects (except month strings) used to be considered less than any
  ``Month`` instance, such a comparison now raises a ``TypeError``.

- Removed deprecated ``Month.isBetween`` method.

----------------

- Support Python 2.7 and PyPy only.

- Add tox as testrunner.


1.4 (2016-02-07)
----------------

- Add a ``__len__`` method to `MonthInterval`.

- Require `z3c.form >= 2.6` to get rid of some odd test dependencies.

  format.


1.2 (2013-02-18)

  this package without the UI parts.

- Added ``firstOfMonth`` method to ``Month``.

- Using `zope.formlib >= 4.0` instead of `zope.app.form`.

- Updated to ZTK 1.1.5.
