Electromagnetic modeller in Python
----------------------------------

The electromagnetic modeller `empymod` can model electric or magnetic responses
due to a three-dimensional electric or magnetic source in a layered-earth model
with vertical transverse isotropy, electric permittivity, and magnetic
permeability, from very low frequencies to very high frequencies.

Installation & requirements
---------------------------

The easiest way to install the latest stable version of `empymod` is via
`conda`:

.. code:: bash

    conda install -c prisae empymod

or via `pip`:

.. code:: bash

   pip install empymod

Alternatively, you can download the latest version from GitHub and either add
the path to `empymod` to your python-path variable, or install it in your
python distribution via:

.. code:: bash

   python setup.py install

Required are python version 3.4 or higher and the modules `NumPy` and `SciPy`.
If you want to run parts of the kernel in parallel, the module `numexpr` is
required additionally.

If you are new to Python I recommend using a Python distribution, which will
ensure that all dependencies are met, specifically properly compiled versions
of `NumPy` and `SciPy`; I recommend using Anaconda (version 3.x;
`continuum.io/downloads <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_).  If you
install Anaconda you can simply start the *Anaconda Navigator*, add the channel
`prisae` and `empymod` will appear in the package list and can be installed
with a click.

Documentation
-------------

The manual of `empymod` can be found at `empymod.readthedocs.io
<http://empymod.readthedocs.io/en/stable>`_.

Examples can be found in the `prisae/empymod-notebooks
<https://github.com/prisae/empymod-notebooks>`_-repository.

Citation
--------

I am in the process of publishing an article in *Geophysics* regarding
`empymod`, and I will put the info here once it is a reality. If you publish
results for which you used `empymod`, please consider citing this article.
Meanwhile, you could cite the Geophysical Tutorial:

Werthmüller, D., 2017, Getting started with controlled-source electromagnetic
1D modeling: The Leading Edge, 36, 352-355; doi: `10.1190/tle36040352.1
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1190/tle36040352.1>`_.

Also consider citing the two articles given below, Hunziker et al. (2015), and
Key (2012), without which `empymod` would not exist. All releases have
additionally a Zenodo-DOI, provided on the `release-page
<https://github.com/prisae/empymod/releases>`_.


Notice
------

This product includes software that was initially (till 01/2017) developed at
*The Mexican Institute of Petroleum IMP* (*Instituto Mexicano del Petróleo*,
`gob.mx/imp <http://www.gob.mx/imp>`_). The project was funded through *The
Mexican National Council of Science and Technology* (*Consejo Nacional de
Ciencia y Tecnología*, `conacyt.mx <http://www.conacyt.mx>`_).


This product is a derivative work of the following two publications and their
publicly available software:
