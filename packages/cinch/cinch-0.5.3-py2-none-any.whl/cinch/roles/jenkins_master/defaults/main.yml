# A list of Jenkins update center URLs to configure. This is the default UC
# provided by the upstream, public infrastructure. If you maintain a local

# If set to true, Jenkins will be run over HTTPS (Jenkins on port 8443 with a
# firewall forward from port 443). If you set this value to true, you MUST
# override jenkins_ssl_cert and jenkins_ssl_key in a production system or you
# will not see any improvements in security
https_enabled: false
# Local path to the SSL certificate to use in configuring HTTPS. This MUST be
# overridden if you want secure access to Jenkins, as these default files are
# available to the public, thus compromising the security of using these values

# This is the password for the Java certificate authority root keystore

# commonly kept among all packagers, and changing this value already requires
# root access to the host system. If your system updates this value, then set
