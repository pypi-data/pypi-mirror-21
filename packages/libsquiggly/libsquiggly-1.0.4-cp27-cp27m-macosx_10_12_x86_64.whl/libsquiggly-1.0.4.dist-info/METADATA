Description: libsquiggly.py
        ==============
        
        Libsquiggly consists of python codes useful in all manner of ubiquitous computing.  Code is organized according to general category:
        
        * `instfreq/` contains all code related to instantaneous frequency estimation
        
        * `tfr/` contains all code related to time/frequency representations such as short-time fourier transforms and generalized cone kernel distribution functions
        
        * `analysis/` contains all code related to communications-type analysis of timeseries
        
        * `resampling/` contains all code related to resampling timeseries
        
        * `util/` contains utility code such as spectrograms, logging standard output, etc...
        
        * `tests/` gives a brief demonstration of some of the abilities of this library, and generates some nice looking pictures.  Run the tests with `python setup.py test`.
        
        If you're wondering how on earth to use this code, running/perusing the examples in the `tests/` directory is a good place to start.
