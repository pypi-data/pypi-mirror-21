## Now with audio sync support!
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/5u1902hw1hqtlldb?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/kusti8/hue-plus)
A Linux driver in Python for the NZXT Hue+

![Fixed](https://github.com/kusti8/hue-plus/raw/master/fixed.png)
![Alternating](https://github.com/kusti8/hue-plus/raw/master/alternating.png)
## Install
### Windows
There is always an easy exe installer available here:
https://github.com/kusti8/hue-plus/releases/latest
### Linux
To install it system wide, simply install using pip:
```
sudo pip3 install hue_plus
```
Now it will be available as `hue` or `hue_ui` for the GUI.

## Quick Start
Each mode accepts different arguments, so it's easiest to just read the usage.
Basic usage is shown below.
### Set a fixed color on all channels
`sudo hue fixed FFFFFF` where FFFFFF is the color in hex.

*or*

`sudo hue -g 1 fixed FFFFFF` will bring up a color picker to choose a color
### Set a specific channel
`sudo hue -c 1 fixed FFFFFF` where 1 is channel one and 2 is channel two
## Usage
```
usage: hue [-h] [-p PORT] [-c CHANNEL] [-g GUI]

No Audio, FPS, CPU temp, GPU temp or Custom, but other than that a perfect replica.

## Warning
  I (the author) hold no liability for any broken or not working Hue+ by running this script. It is provided as is. It worked for me, but your milage may vary
