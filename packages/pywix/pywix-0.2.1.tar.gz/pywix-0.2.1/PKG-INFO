Description: What is this?
        =============
        
        For python applications that need to generate windows installer
        packages, there are two options that I know of: the builtin ``msilib``,
        which is greatly underdeveloped, and this package.
        
        This package wraps ``go-msi``, which is an existing MSI framework that
        allows simple generation of windows installers. ``go-msi`` was chosen
        because it already does the hard work, allowing this package to have a
        tiny footprint.
        
        Most of the code in this package focuses on detecting and installing
        ``go-msi`` and its dependency, the WiX toolset. The principle current
        use of this package is `subzero <https://github.com/xoviat/subzero>`__.
