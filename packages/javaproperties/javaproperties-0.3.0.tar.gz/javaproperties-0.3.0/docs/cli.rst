Command-Line Utilities
======================

`javaproperties` includes three command-line programs for manipulating
``.properties`` files, including support for getting & setting values and
converting files to & from the much more widely-supported JSON format.
Currently, the programs only support ``.properties`` files in the simple
line-oriented format, not XML.
