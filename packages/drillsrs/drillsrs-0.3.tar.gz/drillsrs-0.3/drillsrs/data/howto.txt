How to use

Flashcards are organized in decks, so that you can study multiple subjects at once. To start studying, first create a deck and populate it with cards manually or through an import.

Each "study session" will then display the cards to memorize. Following the study, you'll be invited to a "review session" of all cards shown so far, where your answers will affect how often a given card will be shown for re-evaluation. A correct answer increases the card's score by 1, while a mistake decreases its score by 1.

This is how the score translates into the re-evaluation delay:

Card score  Wait time
0           none (just after the study session)
1           4 hours
2           8 hours
3           1 day
4           3 days
5           1 week
6           2 weeks
7           1 month
8           4 months

For example, if you answered the given card correctly thrice (score 3) and now made a mistake (score is 2 now), this card will re-appear after 8 hours. The score can't fall outside the range in the table.
