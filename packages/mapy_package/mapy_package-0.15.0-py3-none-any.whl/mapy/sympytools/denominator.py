    '''Calculate the conditions that lead to a null denominator

    The denominator is assumed to be any combinations of `variables`
    following the pattern (example with 3 variables):

    >>> v1, v2, v3 = variables
    >>> 1/(sign1*v1 + sign2*v2 + sign3*v3)

    Where `sign1` `sign2` and `sign3` can be `-1` or `+1`, and the
    conditions are obtained by swapping the signs within all possibilities.

    The conditions that are a `(-1)*` (negative) version of another are not
    returned.
