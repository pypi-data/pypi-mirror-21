Description: mapy (modeling-analysis-python)
        ====
        Tool to integrate different pre-processor platforms (Abaqus, NASTRAN, SimXpert).
        The models can be loaded in the Python environment and passed from one
        platform to another.
        
        Composite
        ---------
        A lot of effort has been done in the composite module in order to provide
        efficient and convenient means to calculate the stiffness matrix ABD of
        a laminated composite structure using the Classical Laminated Plate Theory
        (CLPT). When the First-order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) is used the user
        can calculate the matrix ABDE, with E containing the terms related to the
        transverse shear strains.
        
        SymPy utils
        -----------
        The highlight is the differential operator useful to represent and evaluate
        strain-displacement matrices (kinematic relations). Many other functions used
        by other modules are also available.
        
        Structural analysis
        -------------------
        More implementation effort has been applied on structural analysis,
        but it must be improved for any finite element modeling purpose.
        
        Already developed
        -----------------
        - capability to read NASTRAN cards
        - multiple coordinate systems capability 
        - a simple solver for truss elements (RODs)
        - differential operator in SymPy to help on semi-analytical tools
        
        Under development 
        -----------------
        - capability to interface (read/write) thourgh ABAQUS API 
        - fitting cloud of measured points to a given shape function
        
        To be developed
        ---------------
        - a fixed object id for all grids, elements,
        points etc which will keep all references
        
        even if the user changes the entities' ids. Currently there is a lot of search based on python dictionaries by the entity id
        
        - capability to write NASTRAN cards 
        - capability to write ABAQUS cards 
        - capability to interface with SimXpert? API (read/write) 
        - finite element solver for linear analysis (rods, beams, plates and solids)
        OBS: requires numpy, scipy. The project alg3dpy(Google code) is part of this project.
        
        Important
        ---------
        - while the fixed object id for grids, elements etc is not implemented,
        BE CAREFUL when renumbering any entity in the model, since it may loose
        proper reference to the object
