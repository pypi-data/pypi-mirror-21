<:mod:`mapy.sympytools`> aims to bring together many convenient modules
that can are usually applied to derive semi-analytical equations
for any given modeling task. For example, it has been extensively used
to derive the equations for conical/cylindrical shells in DESICOS
(https://github.com/saullocastro/desicos)
