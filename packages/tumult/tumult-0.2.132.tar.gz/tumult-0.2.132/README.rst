Tumult
======

About
-----

Tumult is an oh-my-zsh compatible plugin that adds macOS-specific
functions and scripts to your ZSH environment.

Tumult will check to see if you're running on macOS and not add aliases
or inject its bin into your PATH if you aren't. This allows you to use
the same plugin list in all your environments without polluting your
``$PATH`` with incompatible functions and scripts on your non-Mac
machines.

Other Useful macOS tools
------------------------

-  `Platypus <https://github.com/sveinbjornt/Platypus>`__ - allows you
   to wrap a script inside a Mac GUI wrapper.
-  `awesome-os-command-line <https://github.com/herrbischoff/awesome-osx-command-line>`__
   has a lot of ways to manipulate macOS settings and applications from
   the command line

Installation
------------

Tumult is packaged as a zsh plugin to make it easier to use if you're
already using a zsh framework (I recommend zgen, it is wicked fast and
also supports using oh-my-zsh's internal plugins).

Bash / not using a framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're using bash, or aren't using a framework, you can either \*
Clone this repository and add its bin directory to your ``$PATH`` \* Use
``pip`` to install with ``pip install tumult``. Because I have to
explicitly publish new versions to pypi, the pip package may not alaways
be as current as the git repository.

`Antigen <https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add ``antigen bundle unixorn/tumult.plugin.zsh`` to your ``.zshrc`` with
your other bundle commands.

Antigen will handle cloning the plugin for you automatically the next
time you start zsh. You can also add the plugin to a running zsh with
``antigen bundle unixorn/tumult.plugin.zsh`` for testing before adding
it to your ``.zshrc``.

`Oh-My-Zsh <http://ohmyz.sh/>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. ``cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins``
2. ``git clone git@github.com:unixorn/tumult.plugin.zsh.git tumult``
3. Add tumult to your plugin list - edit ``~.zshrc`` and change
   ``plugins=(...)`` to ``plugins=(... tumult)``

`Zgen <https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add ``zgen load unixorn/tumult.plugin.zsh`` to your .zshrc file in the
same function you're doing your other ``zgen load`` calls in. Zgen will
handle automatically cloning the plugin for you the next time you do a
``zgen save``.
