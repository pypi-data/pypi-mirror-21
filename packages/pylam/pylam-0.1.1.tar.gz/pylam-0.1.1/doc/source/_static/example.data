LAMMPS Description           (1st line of file)

100 atoms         (this must be the 3rd line, 1st 2 lines are ignored)
95 bonds                (# of bonds to be simulated)
50 angles               (include these lines even if number = 0)
30 dihedrals
20 impropers

5 atom types           (# of nonbond atom types)
10 bond types          (# of bond types = sets of bond coefficients)
18 angle types         
20 dihedral types      (do not include a bond,angle,dihedral,improper type
2 improper types             line if number of bonds,angles,etc is 0)

-0.5 0.5 xlo xhi       (for periodic systems this is box size,
-0.5 0.5 ylo yhi        for non-periodic it is min/max extent of atoms)
-0.5 0.5 zlo zhi       (do not include this line for 2-d simulations)
