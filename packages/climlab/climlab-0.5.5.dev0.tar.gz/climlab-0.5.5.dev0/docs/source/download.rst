Code

Stables releases as well as the current development version can be found on github:

  * `Stable Releases <https://github.com/brian-rose/climlab/releases>`_
  * `Development Version <https://github.com/brian-rose/climlab>`_


Dependencies
------------
`climlab` is written in `Python 2.7 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ and the requires the following `Python` packages to run:

  * `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_
  * `Scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_
  * `NetCDF4 <https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/>`_

**Optional packages:**

  * `Jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>`_ (to run Jupyter notebooks containing tutorials and introduction for climlab)
  * `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ (plotting libary)

The packages have to be installed on your machine. Either they can be individially downloaded, compiled and installed according to the the instructions on the corresponding websites. 

Easier to handle however are Python distributions like `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ or `Enthought Canopy <https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/>`_ which already include many popular Python packages.

Setup environment with Anaconda
###############################

An example is given here how to set up a python environment with `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_.

	A new environment named ``climlab_env`` with all above packages is created like this:

		.. code-block:: console

			$ conda create --name climlab_env numpy scipy netcdf4 jupyter matplotlib
       
	All new packages which will be installed are displayed including their version number. Press ``y`` to proceed.
	
	After the environment is build, it can be activated with

		.. code-block:: console

			$ source activate climlab_env

	and can be deactivated with

		.. code-block:: console

			$ source deactivate

	
To install climlab in the new environment follow the steps below.        

Installation
------------

Stable Release
##############

	With the Python package `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_, which collects the current version from the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_, climlab can be easily installed on a machine through the terminal command

		.. code-block:: console

			$ pip install climlab

Development Version
###################

	Otherwise, the package can be downloaded from the above referred link and installed manually through running from the package directory

		.. code-block:: console

			$ python setup.py install

	for a regular system wide installation.

	In case you want to develop new code, run following command (which also has an uninstall option):

		.. code-block:: console

			$ python setup.py develop
