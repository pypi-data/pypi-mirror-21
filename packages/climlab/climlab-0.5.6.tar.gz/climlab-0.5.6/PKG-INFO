        Installation
        --------------
        
        Installing pre-built binaries with conda (Mac OSX and Linux)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The simplest and recommended way to install ``climlab`` is using conda_
        (which is the wonderful package manager that comes with `Anaconda Python`_).
        
        On Mac OSX and Linux, you can install ``climlab`` and all its dependencies with::
        
            conda install -c conda-forge climlab
        
        Or (recommended) add ``conda-forge`` to your conda channels with::
        
            conda config --add channels conda-forge
        
        and then simply do::
        
            conda install climlab
        
        Installing from source
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        If you do not use conda, you can install ``climlab`` from source with::
        
            pip install climlab
        
        (which will download the latest stable release from the `pypi repository`_ and trigger the build process.)
        
        Alternatively, clone the source code repository with::
        
            git clone https://github.com/brian-rose/climlab.git
        
        and, from the ``climlab`` directory, do::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        You will need a Fortran compiler on your system.
        The build has been tested with both gcc/gfortran and ifort (Linux)
        
        Installing on Windows
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Currently, building from source (see above) is your only option.
        You will need a Fortran compiler, and may possibly need to build ``numpy`` from source as well.
        
        I would love to hear from anyone who tries and/or succeeds to build ``climlab`` on Windows!
        
        Note that many parts of ``climlab`` are written in pure Python and will work on any system, Windows included.
        Fortran builds are necessary for the RRTMG and CAM3 radiation schemes.

        About climlab
        --------------
        ``climlab`` is a flexible engine for process-oriented climate modeling.
        It is based on a very general concept of a model as a collection of individual,
        interacting processes. ``climlab`` defines a base class called ``Process``, which
        can contain an arbitrarily complex tree of sub-processes (each also some
        sub-class of ``Process``). Every climate process (radiative, dynamical,
        physical, turbulent, convective, chemical, etc.) can be simulated as a stand-alone
        process model given appropriate input, or as a sub-process of a more complex model.
        New classes of model can easily be defined and run interactively by putting together an
        appropriate collection of sub-processes.
        
        Currently, ``climlab`` has out-of-the-box support and documented examples for
        
        - Radiative and radiative-convective column models, with various radiation schemes:
            - RRTMG (a widely used radiative transfer code)
            - CAM3  (from the NCAR GCM)
            - Grey Gas
            - Simplified band-averaged models (4 bands each in longwave and shortwave)
        - Diffusive energy balance models
        - Seasonal and steady-state models
        - Arbitrary combinations of the above, for example:
            - 2D latitude-pressure models with radiation, horizontal diffusion, and fixed relative humidity
        - Orbital / insolation calculations
        - Boundary layer sensible and latent heat fluxes

        Dependencies
        -----------------
        
        These are handled automatically if you install with conda_.
        
        Required
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        - Python 2.7  (compatibility with Python 3 coming soon!)
        - ``numpy``
        - ``scipy``
        - ``netCDF4`` Python package (for data i/o)
        
        Recommended for full functionality
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        - ``numba`` (used for acceleration of some components)
        - ``pytest`` (to run the automated tests, important if you are developing new code)
        
        `Anaconda Python`_ is highly recommended and will provide everything you need.
        
        
        Documentation and Examples
        ------------------
        Full user manual is available here_.
        
        The directory ``climlab/courseware/`` also contains a collection of Jupyter
        notebooks (*.ipynb) used for teaching some basics of climate science,
        and documenting use of the ``climlab`` package.
        These are self-describing, and should all run out-of-the-box once the package is installed, e.g:
        
        ``jupyter notebook Insolation.ipynb``

        History
        ----------------------
        The first versions of the code and notebooks were originally developed in winter / spring 2014
        in support of an undergraduate course at the University at Albany.
        See the original course webpage at
        http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ENV480_Spring2014/
        
        The package and its API was completely redesigned around a truly object-oriented
        modeling framework in January 2015.
        
        It was used extensively for a graduate-level climate modeling course in Spring 2015:
        http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM623_Spring2015/
        Many more examples are found in the online lecture notes for that course:
        http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/brian-rose/ClimateModeling_courseware/blob/master/index.ipynb
        
        Version 0.3 was released in February 2016. It includes many internal changes and
        some backwards-incompatible changes (hopefully simplifications) to the public API.
        It also includes the CAM3 radiation module.
        
        Version 0.4 was released in October 2016. It includes comprehensive documentation,
        an automated test suite, support for latitude-longitude grids, and numerous small enhancements and bug fixes.
        
        Version 0.4.2 (released January 2017) introduces the RRTMG radiation scheme,
        a much-improved build process for the Fortran extension,
        and numerous enhancements and simplifications to the API.
        
        Version 0.5 (released March 2017) provides bug fixes and full functionality for the RRTMG module,
        an improved common API for all radiation modules, and better documentation.
        
        Version 0.5.2 (released late March 2017) provides many under-the-hood improvements to the build procedure,
        which should make it much easier to get `climlab` installed on user machines. Binary distribution with conda_ is coming soon!
        
        Version 0.5.5 (released early April 2017) finally provides easy binary distrbution with conda_
        
        The documentation_ was first created by Moritz Kreuzer (Potsdam Institut for Climate Impact Research) as part of a thesis project in Spring 2016.
