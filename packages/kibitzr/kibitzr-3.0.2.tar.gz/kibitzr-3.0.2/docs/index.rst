Kibitzr - Personal Network Assistant
=====================================

Kibitzr is like a secret twin brother who does routine tasks and asks for nothing in return.

* `Install`_ with ``pip install kibitzr`` (Works with both Python 2 and 3)
* :ref:`Configure <configuration>` recurrent tasks in ``kibitzr.yml``
* Put credentials in ``kibitzr-creds.yml``
* Launch with ``kibitzr``
* Problems? Ask in Github issues_, or gitter_
* Fork_

Kibitzr is built with extendability in mind.

For simple HTTP requests it uses `Python requests`_.
And for complex browser interactions it offers headless Firefox with Selenium_ scenarios.
Or go wild with bash_ scripts (linux only).

Send notifications through e-mail, Slack or gitter (open issue_ for new notifier).
Or build your own notifier in Python_ or bash_.
