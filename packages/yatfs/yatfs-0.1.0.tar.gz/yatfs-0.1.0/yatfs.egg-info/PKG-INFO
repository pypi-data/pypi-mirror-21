        =====
        ------------------------------
        yet another torrent filesystem
        ------------------------------
        
        ``yatfs`` is a filesystem where every file is backed by bittorrent.
        
        You can work with the file and directory structure in a ``yatfs`` filesystem
        like any other -- make directories, make symlinks/hardlinks, and move things
        around. However all files are read-only.
