``maildrake-smtp``
is the SMTP server for Mail Drake. It receives mail transport requests
and stores the messages for later inspection in a queue.

..  note::

    Mail Drake is not a full Mail Transport Agent, it is as fake as a
    duck in a postman's hat.

    Specifically, the SMTP service **will not** transport messages!
    The messages are stored in a local database for later inspection
    and never sent to their declared destination.
