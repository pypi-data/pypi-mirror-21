fnExchange is a scalable, open source API layer (also called an API
"router") that provides a consistent proxy web interface for invoking
various web APIs without the caller having to write separate,
special-purpose code for each of them.

fnExchange is packaged as a command line interface executable
``fnexchange`` which starts the web service. The CLI also supports a
mode to run the service as a daemon.

Installation, usage and plugin development instructions can be found
on the project's `GitHub page <http://github.com/dnif/fnExchange>`_
