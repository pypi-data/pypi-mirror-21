Description: 
        fnExchange is a scalable, open source API layer (also called an API
        "router") that provides a consistent proxy web interface for invoking
        various web APIs without the caller having to write separate,
        special-purpose code for each of them.
        
        fnExchange is packaged as a command line interface executable
        ``fnexchange`` which starts the web service. The CLI also supports a
        mode to run the service as a daemon.
        
        Installation, usage and plugin development instructions can be found
        on the project's `GitHub page <http://github.com/dnif/fnExchange>`_
