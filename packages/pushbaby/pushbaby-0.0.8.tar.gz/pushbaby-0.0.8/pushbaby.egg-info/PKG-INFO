Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        PushBaby is a simple APNS library using gevent. PushBaby aims to
        do the hard bits of APNS for you and no more. It handles:
        
        * Packing APNS messages into the binary payload format
        * Establishing and reestablishing SSL connections
        * Receiving and propagating errors to your application, asynchronously
        * Encoding pushes to JSON using efficient encoding
        * Truncating messages to fit APNS
        * Retrying pushes on nonfatal errors
        
        PushBaby takes APNS payloads as dictionaries: it does not attempt to
        construct them for you.
        
        PushBaby does not load balance over multiple connections, although
        this is something that would be considered in the future.
        
        If you use PushBaby, remember that the rest of your application
        must be gevent compatible, or you'll find PushBaby won't do
        important things like receive errors.
        
        Why PushBaby?
        =============
        There are many alternative APNS libraries for Python, for example:
        
        applepushnotification
          https://github.com/martinkou/applepushnotification
          Similar, gevent-based library. Unmaintained.
        apns
          https://github.com/djacobs/PyAPNs
          Uses pure python threads but will not always feed back errors if pushes can't
          be sent to the gateway.
        pyapns
          https://github.com/samuraisam/pyapns/tree/master
          A full-featured XML-RPC HTTP-to-APNS server.
        apns-clerk
          https://bitbucket.org/aleksihoffman/apns-clerk
          Fork of apns-client. Waits for error responses but means all calls to send a
          push block synchronously for some time.
        APNSWrapper / HypnoAPNSWrapper
          https://code.google.com/p/apns-python-wrapper/
          Unmaintained. Uses openssl s_client.
        apns-client
          https://bitbucket.org/sardarnl/apns-client
          Unmaintained
