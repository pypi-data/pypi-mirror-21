What is pyvaru?
---------------

Pyvaru is a simple, flexible and unobtrusive data validation library for Python 3 (3.4+),
based on the concept of validation rules.

From the software design point of view, a rule is a class implementing the strategy pattern, 
by encapsulating the validation logic in an interface method called ``apply()``.

The library already offers a series of common validation rules like:
 
- ``TypeRule`` (it checks that the target value is an instance of the expected type)
- ``FullStringRule`` (it checks the the target value is a string with content)
- ``ChoiceRule`` (it checks that the target value is contained in a list of available options)
- ``MinValueRule`` (it checks that the target value is >= x) *
- ``MaxValueRule`` (it checks that the target value is <= x) *
- ``MinLengthRule`` (it checks that the target value length is >= x) *
- ``MaxLengthRule`` (it checks that the target value length is <= x) *
- ``RangeRule`` (it checks that the target value is contained in a given ``range``)
- ``IntervalRule`` (it checks that the target value is contained in a given interval)
- ``PatternRule`` (it checks that the target value matches a given regular expression)
- ``PastDateRule`` (it checks that the target value is a date in the past)
- ``FutureDateRule`` (it checks that the target value is a date in the future)
- ``UniqueItemsRule`` (it checks that the target iterable does not contain duplicated items)
 

\* where "x" is a provided reference value

The developer is then free to create his custom rules by extending the abstract ``ValidationRule``
and implementing the logic in the ``apply()`` method. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    class ContainsHelloRule(ValidationRule):
        def apply(self) -> bool:
            return 'hello' in self.apply_to

These rules are then executed by a ``Validator``, which basically executes them in the provided
order and eventually returns a ``ValidationResult`` containing the validation response.


Installation
------------

``pip install pyvaru``


Usage
-----
    
Given an existing model to validate, like the one below
(but it could be a simple dictionary or any data structure since `pyvaru`
does not make any assumption on the data format):

.. code-block:: python

    class User:
        def __init__(self, first_name: str, last_name: str, date_of_birth: datetime, sex: str):
            self.first_name = first_name
            self.last_name = last_name
            self.date_of_birth = date_of_birth
            self.sex = sex

        
We have to define a validator, by implementing the ``get_rules()`` method and for each field we want to
validate we have to provide one or more proper rule(s).

.. code-block:: python

    from pyvaru import Validator
    from pyvaru.rules import TypeRule, FullStringRule, ChoiceRule, PastDateRule

    class UserValidator(Validator):
        def get_rules(self) -> list:
            user = self.data # type: User
            return [
                TypeRule(apply_to=user,
                         label='User',
                         valid_type=User,
                         error_message='User must be an instance of user model.',
                         stop_if_invalid=True),
                FullStringRule(lambda: user.first_name, 'First name'),
                FullStringRule(lambda: user.last_name, 'Last name'),
                ChoiceRule(lambda: user.sex, 'Sex', choices=('M', 'F')),
                PastDateRule(lambda: user.date_of_birth, 'Date of birth')
            ]


It's also possible to create groups of rules by using ``RuleGroup`` and avoid code duplication if multiple rules should
be applied to the same field. So this code:

.. code-block:: python

    def get_rules(self) -> list:
        return [
            TypeRule(lambda: self.data.countries, 'Countries', valid_type=list),
            MinLengthRule(lambda: self.data.countries, 'Countries', min_length=1),
            UniqueItemsRule(lambda: self.data.countries, 'Countries')
        ]


can be replaced by:

.. code-block:: python

    def get_rules(self) -> list:
        return [
            RuleGroup(lambda: self.data.countries,
                      'Countries',
                      rules=[(TypeRule, {'valid_type': list}),
                             (MinLengthRule, {'min_length': 1}),
                             UniqueItemsRule])
        ]


Finally we have two choices regarding how to use our custom validator:
    
1. As a context processor:

.. code-block:: python

    with UserValidator(user):
        # do whatever you want with your valid model

In this case the code inside ``with`` will be executed only if the validation succeed, otherwise a
``ValidationException`` (containing a ``validation_result`` property with the appropriate report) is raised.
        
2. By invoking the ``validate()`` method (which returns a ``ValidationResult``)

.. code-block:: python

    validation = UserValidator(user).validate()
    if validation.is_successful():
        # do whatever you want with your valid model
    else:
        # you can take a proper action and access validation.errors
        # in order to provide a useful message to the application user,
        # write logs or whatever


Assuming we have a instance of an User configured as the one below:

.. code-block:: python

    user = User(first_name=' ',
                last_name=None,
                date_of_birth=datetime(2020, 1, 1),
                sex='unknown')


By running a validation with the previous defined rules we will obtain a ``ValidationResult`` with the following errors:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        'First name': ['String is empty.'],
        'Last name': ['Not a string.'],
        'Sex': ['Value not found in available choices.'],
        'Date of birth': ['Not a past date.']
    }
