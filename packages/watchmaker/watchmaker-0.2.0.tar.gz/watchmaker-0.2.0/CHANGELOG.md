# Changelog

0.2.0 (2017.04.06)

*   [[Issue #238][238]] Captures all unhandled exceptions and logs them
*   [[Issue #234][234]] Stops the salt service prior to managing salt formulas,
    to ensure that the filesystem does not throw any errors about the files
    being locked
*   [[Issue #72][72]] Manages salt service so the service state after
    watchmaker completes is the same as it was prior to running watchmaker. If
    the service was running beforehand, it remains running afterwards. If the
    service was stopped (or non-existent) beforehad, the service remains
    stopped afterwards
*   [[Issue #163][163]] Modifies the `user_formulas` config option to support
    a map of `<formula_name>:<formula_url>`
*   [[PR #235][235]] Extracts salt content to the same target `srv` location
    for both Window and Linux. Previously, the salt content was extracted to
    different points in the filesystem hierarchy, which required different
    content for Windows and Linux. Now the same salt content archive can be
    used for both
*   [[PR #242][242]] Renames salt worker param `content_source` to
    `salt_content`
*   systemprep-formula
    *   Deprecated and removed. Replaced by new salt content structure that
        uses native salt capabilities to map states to a system
*   scc-formula
    *   Deprecated and removed. Replaced by scap-formula
*   scap-formula
    *   New bundled salt formula. Provides SCAP scans using either `openscap`
        or `scc`
*   pshelp-formula
    *   New bundled salt formula. Installs updated PowerShell help content to
        Windows systems
