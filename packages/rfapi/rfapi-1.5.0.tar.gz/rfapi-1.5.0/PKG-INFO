Description: rfapi-python
        ============
        
        Python 2/3 library for using the Recorded Future API
        
        Recorded Future's API enables you to build analytic applications and
        perform analysis which is aware of events happening around the globe
        24x7. You can perform queries and receive results from the Recorded
        Future Temporal Analytics Engine across a vast set of events,
        entities, and time points spanning from the far past into the future.
        
        See the `API documentation <https://github.com/recordedfuture/api/wiki/RecordedFutureAPI>`__
        and `GitHub source <https://github.com/recordedfuture/rfapi-python>`__
        for further details and example usage.
        
        To install with pip run ``pip install rfapi``
        
        An API token is required to use the Recorded Future API. You can request
        a Recorded Future API token by contacting support@recordedfuture.com or
        your account representative. The easiest way to setup your program is to
        save your api token inside an enviroment variable ``RF_TOKEN``. It is
        also possible to explicitely pass a token in the constructor.
