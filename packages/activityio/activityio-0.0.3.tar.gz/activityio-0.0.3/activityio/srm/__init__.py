"""
Decode Schoberer Rad Messtechnik (SRM) power files.

This code was adapted largely from the GoldenCheetah code base [1]_.

Rainer Clasen [2]_, developer of the `srmio` utility, was also kind enough to
provide a file format specification. This specification, though incomplete, can
be found in 'references' at the root of this package.
