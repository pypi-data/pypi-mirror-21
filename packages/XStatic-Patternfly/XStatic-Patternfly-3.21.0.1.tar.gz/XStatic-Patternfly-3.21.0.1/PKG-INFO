        ======================
        
        Patternfly style library packaged for setuptools (easy_install) / pip.
        
        This package is intended to be used by **any** project that needs these files.
        
        It intentionally does **not** provide any extra code except some metadata
        **nor** has any extra requirements. You MAY use some minimal support code from
        the XStatic base package, if you like.
