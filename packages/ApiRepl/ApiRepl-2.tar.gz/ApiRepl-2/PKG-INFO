Description: # ApiRepl
        
        ## What it is
        If you want API data copied to your database, the workers should fetch for you elastically.
        
        ## Setup
        ### Database Requirement
        use schema.sql to create a database, and load it with the types of information you need
        ### Subclass BaseWorker
        see samples/usage.py for an example.
        Create an api method and save method for your workflow by subclassing BaseWorker.
        
        ## Functionality (requirements)
        * Splits update task into pieces
        * Prioritizes pieces
        * Can be paused and resumed
        * Can scale across hosts easily using DB
        * Good test coverage (soon :) )
