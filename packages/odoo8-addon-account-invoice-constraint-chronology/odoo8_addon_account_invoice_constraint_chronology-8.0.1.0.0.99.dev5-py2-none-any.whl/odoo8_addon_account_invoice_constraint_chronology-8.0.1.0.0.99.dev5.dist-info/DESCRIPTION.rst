Account Invoice Constraint Chronology
=====================================

This module helps ensuring the chronology of invoice numbers.

It prevents the validation of invoices when:
* there are draft invoices with an anterior date
* there are validated invoices with a posterior date

The check can be activated on a per-journal basis
(for sale and purchase journals).
