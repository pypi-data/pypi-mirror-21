        Info
        ~~~~
        
        Project has started in April 2017. So there are not a lot of things
        online right now.
        
        The goal of the project is to build some nice functionality for many
        tasks with which scientists have to deal on a daily basis.
        
        Feel free to make suggestions to the project and I'm looking forward to
        any contributions.
        
        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Simply use the Python package index to install PyOmics. This way is
        recommended since it provides full pip functionality (upgrade,
        uninstall).
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ pip install PyOmics
        
        Alternatively, you can clone the repository and manually run setup.py.
        This will always give you the latest version of PyOmics, but might be
        unstable at some point.
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/FloBay/PyOmics.git
            $ cd <path_to>/PyOmics
            $ python setup.py install
        
        Documentation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        There is no official documentation file available (so far). Sorry about
        that !! At some point in the future, however, there will be one
        available.
        
        Meanwhile, PyOmics places a high premium on well documented source code
        in compliance with several PEPs. Docstrings are written according to the
        NumPy/SciPy Documentation formatting Guide.
