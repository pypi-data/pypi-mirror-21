        Features
        --------
        
        * Generate LookML views programmatically
        * Include dimensions, dimension groups, filters, and measures in your views
        * Support Persistent Derived Tables (PDTs)
        * Write output to files or StringIO buffers
        
        Quick Start
        -----------
        
        Install it::
        
            pip install lookml-gen
        
        Use it::
        
            from lookmlgen.view import View
            from lookmlgen.field import Dimension, Measure
        
            view_name = 'my_view'
            v = View(view_name)
            v.add_field(Dimension('id', type='number', primary_key=True))
            v.add_field(Dimension('c', type='number'))
            v.add_field(Measure('sum_c', sql='${TABLE}.c', type='sum'))
        
            with open('%s.view.lkml' % view_name, 'w') as f:
                v.generate_lookml(f)

            view: my_view {
        
              dimension: c {
                type: number
                sql: ${TABLE}.c ;;
              }
        
              dimension: id {
                primary_key: yes
                type: number
                sql: ${TABLE}.id ;;
              }
        
              measure: sum_c {
                type: sum
                sql: ${TABLE}.c ;;
              }
            }
        
        TODOs
        -----
        
        Full LookML support is far from complete right now. At the moment only very basic
        aspects of Views and Fields are supported and there is no support for Explores yet.
        However, it does cover the most common functionality, including Persistent Derived
        Tables. The code can easily be extended and we'd love to get pull requests to fill
        out additional functionality.
