Description: # GeoFluent Python Client
        
        Unofficial Python Client to access the [GeoFluent API](http://www.lionbridge.com/geofluent/). 
        
        It has been developed by [Redlink GmbH](http://redlink.co/) in the context of the [SSIX Project](https://ssix-project.eu/);
        further details at [this blog post](https://ssix-project.eu/opensourcing-java-and-python-clients-geofluent-api/).
        
        ## API
        
        Upon usage of the [GeoFluent API](http://www.lionbridge.com/geofluent/) you **need to register** an account there.
        
        You can find further technical documentation at:
        
        * [API v3 Swagger Documentation](https://api.geofluent.com/Translation/swagger/docs/v3)
        * [API v3 Swagger UI](https://api.geofluent.com/Translation/swagger/ui/index)
        
        The current status of implementation of the [GeoFluent API](http://www.lionbridge.com/geofluent/)
        is the following:

        ## Installation
        
        The modules is [available from PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geofluent),
        so you just need to install it:
        
            pip install geofluent
        	
        ## Usage
        
        ### Library
        
            from geofluent import GeoFluent
        
            gf = GeoFluent(key=key, secret=secret)
        	
            // retrieve available languages
            languages = gf.languages()
            print("Languages supported:" + ", ".join(["%s->%s" % language for language in languages]))
            
            // translate from German to English
            translation = gf.translate("Ich werde es testen", "de-de", "en-xn");
            print("Translation: " + translation);
        
        ### Command-Line
        
        You can can use the CLI tool to translate each line of file and get the translations back as CSV:
        
            geofluent key secret source target file.txt
        
        With `geofluent -h` you get some additional help of its usage.
        
        Notice that you may need to address it as `python3 geofluent/cli.py` if you didn't globally install the library.
        
        ### Microservice
        
        In case you need to locally expose it as a microservice, the modules provides a dedicated utility to proxy that:
        
            python3 geofluent/cli.py key secret [port]
