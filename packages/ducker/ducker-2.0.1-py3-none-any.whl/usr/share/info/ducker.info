1.1 Purpose
===========

The purpose of Ducker is to provide a quick way to make internet
searches using DuckDuckGo without getting out of the command-line
interface.  It is very useful for people using an operating system
without GUI and for people who like using the terminal for everything.

1.2 Install Ducker
==================

Ducker works with Python 3 in any operating system with Python.  Install
it running the following command:

     ‘pip install ducker’

1.3 Use it
==========

Once installed, you can use it with ‘duck’ or ‘ducker’ commands.
Imagine that you are looking for cheap skateboards, you can make Ducker
launch a search with the following command:

     ‘duck buy cheap skateboard’

2 Making advanced searches
**************************

From Ducker you can do pretty much the same that you can do with
DuckDuckGo.  It has options to search for images, videos and websites,
to filter results by date, by website...  To check out every available
option execute ‘duck -h’.

You can search for images of ducks executing ‘duck -i ducks’ or the long
form ‘duck --image-search ducks’.  It’s very intuitive.

You can also use DuckDuckGo bangs(1) and other nice features of
DuckDuckGo.  Note that you must escape the exclamation mark (!)  in Bash
when using bangs.  To go directly to the website of the first search
result you can execute ‘ducker ! freakspot.net’ or ‘duck
\\freakspot.net’.  You can make this types of searches more comfortable
to type using aliases for your shell (see *note Customization: 9.).

DuckDuckGo makes spell corrections sometimes.  If you don’t the spelling
of your results be corrected, then use the ‘--exact’ flag.

You can even filter results by date with the ‘-t’ and ‘--time’ options.
You must specify the time limit: a (any time), d (past day), w (past
week), m (past month).  For instance, ‘ducker -t d cats’ will get you
the results from the past day related to cats.

If you just want to output the search results pages you can use the
‘--np’ and ‘--noprompt’ options, which will perform the search, output
it in the terminal and exit.  If you prefer to output it in JSON format,
you can use the ‘--json’ parameter.

3 Interactive mode
******************

Ducker comes with a powerful interactive mode, that allows you to view
the information about results and open them from it.  It can also be
used to show more or less results at will.  You can even specify the
proxy of your network, if you have one.  If you find a bunch of useful
results and you want to open them at the same time, you can.  For
example, execute ‘o 1 3 4’, if you want to open the results 1, 3 and 5.
To check out every option inside the interactive mode, just type ‘?’ and
press ‘Enter’.

To launch the interactive mode, just execute Ducker without any
arguments.  You can also specify command-line options.  Most options
work both in interactive and in non-interactive mode.

If you don’t like the appearence of the interactive mode, you can change
it specifying the terminal colors using the option ‘--colors’.  For more
information about that check *note Colors of the interactive mode: d.
Or if you don’t like colors, you can use the option ‘--nocolors’.

DuckDuckGo makes spell corrections some times.  If you don’t want your
spelling to be corrected by DuckDuckGo, then use the ‘--exact’ flag.

4 Autocompletion
****************

Ducker comes with autocompletion files for Bash and for Fish.  If you
have any of those shells, you should get autocompletion support when you
install Ducker with pip.  When you install Ducker manually, you must
copy the file ‘autocompletion/ducker.bash’ to ‘/etc/bash_completion.d/’
if you use Bash, or copy the file ‘autocompletion/ducker.fish’ to
‘/etc/fish/functions’ or to ‘~/.config/fish/functions’ if you use Fish.

File: ducker.info,  Node: Aliases,  Next: Colors of the interactive mode,  Up: Customization

5.1 Aliases
===========

If you use an option of Ducker very often, you should consider making a
shortcut for it in your shell.  In Bash-like shells, you can make
aliases.  Let’s say we want to add an option to search for articles in
Wikipedia; we can create a Bash alias for that.

     ‘alias wikipedia='ducker \!w'’

After that, calling ‘wikipedia’ in the shell will open the main page of
wikipedia, and calling ‘wikipedia free software’ would open the "Free
software" article from wikipedia(1).  Note that we’re using DuckDuckGo
bangs(2) and that the exclamation mark (!)  must be escaped in Bash.  To
make Bash remember your alias for your next sessions you must add it to
your ‘.bashrc’ file.

5.2 Colors of the interactive mode
==================================

Ducker allows you to customize the color scheme via a six-letter string,
reminiscent of BSD LSCOLORS. The six letters represent the colors of:

   - indices,

   - titles,

   - URLs,

   - nothing (may probably be used in a later version),

   - abstracts,

   - and prompts

respectively.  The six-letter string is passed in either as the argument
to the –colors option.

We offer the following colors/styles:

     Letter     Color/Style
                
     -----------------------------------------------------------------
                
     a          black
                
                
     b          red
                
                
     c          green
                
                
     d          yellow
                
                
     e          blue
                
                
     f          magenta
                
                
     g          cyan
                
                
     h          white
                
                
     i          bright black
                
                
     j          bright red
                
                
     k          bright green
                
                
     l          bright yellow
                
                
     m          bright blue
                
                
     n          bright magenta
                
                
     o          bright cyan
                
                
     p          bright white
                
                
     A-H        bold version of the lowercase-letter color
                
                
     I-P        bold version of the lowercase-letter bright color
                
                
     x          normal
                
                
     X          bold
                
                
     y          reverse video
                
                
     Y          bold reverse video
                

The default colors string is GKlgxy, which stands for

   - bold bright cyan indices

   - bold bright green titles

   - bright yellow URLs

   - cyan metadata/publishing info

   - normal abstracts

   - reverse video prompts

Note that:

   - Bright colors (implemented as x1b[90m - x1b[97m) may not be
     available in all color-capable terminal emulators;

   - Some terminal emulators draw bold text in bright colors instead;

   - Some terminal emulators only distinguish between bold and bright
     colors via a default-off switch.

Please consult the manual of your terminal emulator as well as
‘https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code’ for details.
